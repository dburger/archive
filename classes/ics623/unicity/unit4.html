<H2>Unit 5-Unicity Distance</H2>

<P>Study the notes here and do the problems given at the end of these notes. Read 
  Section 11.1 in the book, but don't make a great effort to understand it well. 
  I think you can understand my notes well if you try, and it is better to put 
  your effort there. I figure this for one week's work. It isn't long, but I think 
  the ideas are a little hard to grasp.</P>

<H3>Section 11.1--information Theory</H3>

<P>Section 11.1 deals with unicity distance and a couple of other topics. It gives 
  a formula for unicity distance that I have often seen misapplied, and doesn't 
  really give insight into where it came from. It is dangerous to try to use information 
  theory unless you understand it well. I suggest reading this section, but just 
  for a general understanding. I will furnish my own explanation here, which I 
  believe you can understand more clearly and more easily than what is given in 
  the book..</P>

<P>Incidentally, Section 11.3 deals with complexity theory. It would seem to be 
  very relevant, because most codes rely on having deciphering computationally 
  too complex if you don't have the key, and simple if you do. A number of codes 
  based on complexity theory have been proposed, but so far none has proved safe 
  from cryptanalysts. When one is found, then I will include complexity theory 
  in ICS623. You are welcome to try. The best known codes of this type are based 
  on the knapsack problem in complexity theory--see Section 19.2.</P>

<H3>Unicity Distance</H3>

<P>You have some ciphertext but you don't have the corresponding cleartext.
You are going to decipher it by brute force--you are simply going to decipher
it using every key, at least until you find the plaintext message. But suppose
you get something that looks like plain text. How do you know that it did
not result by pure chance from the deciphering process? If you have a very
small amount of ciphertext, this kind of thing is likely to happen. If you
have a long piece of ciphertext, then it is less likely. How much ciphertext
do you need?</P>

<P>We will assume that if you decipher some ciphertext using the wrong key, every 
  possible sequence is equally likely, i. e. that unless you have the correct 
  key, the result is essentially random. This is genereally a reasonable assumption, 
  but in general it is probably not provable. (I guess Shannon was the first one 
  who made this assumption.) What we are going to calculate is, on the average 
  if you try all keys, how many of the resulting wrong &quot;plaintext&quot; messages 
  look like what you expect enough so you might accept them mistakenly. Again, 
  we will assume that if you have the wrong key, what you get is essentially random--all 
  possible deciphered &quot;messages&quot; are equally likely.</P>

<P>Suppose I have N objects and M of them are acceptable. Then if I choose K of 
  them, the expected number of acceptable ones among those K is K*(M/N), i. e. 
  the expected percentage of acceptable ones in the chosen set is the same as 
  the percentage of acceptable ones in the entire set. (This assumes that I can 
  choose the same one twice, i. e. selection with replacement. I frankly don't 
  know that you cannot get the same plaintext with two different keys, so this 
  is probably appropriate.) So now I want to know A) the total number N of possible 
  outputs of the decrypter, B) how many of them (M) might be accepted mistakenly 
  as the actual plaintext, and C) the total number K of keys. In general, these 
  numbers depend on the amount of plaintext, and the expected number of false 
  messages decreases as the plaintext gets longer. The length of plaintext that 
  gives just one expected false message is called <I>unicity distance</I>. You 
  certainly don't want less ciphertext than that, because then when you see an 
  acceptable message, you can't know whether or not you have the correct message. 
  In fact, if the amount of ciphertext that you have equals the unicity distance, 
  you expect one false message and the real message, and you can't tell which 
  of them is the real message. If you have substantially more than the unicity 
  distance amount, then you are unlikely to see a false message. Probably after 
  you try all keys, there will be only one acceptable message, and it is the correct 
  one.</P>

<P>We need some examples. Suppose we are sending seven-bit characters, and the 
  output of our decipherer is a string of seven-bit characters. However, the actual 
  message has only printable characters, and we would accept any sequence of all 
  printable characters. Let us assume 40-bit keys, so there are K=2^40 keys. From 
  the ascii chart, we can see that all the characters from 20 hex to 7e hex inclusive 
  are printable and all the others are not printable. (I count the blank space, 
  which is 20 hex, as printable.) That is a total of 95 characters.Let us assume 
  a string of n characters. Then the number of possible sequences of n seven-bit 
  characters is N=128^n or 2^(7*n). The number of n-character strings that we 
  would accept is M=95^n. Then the expected number of false messages would be 
  KM/N = (2^40-1)*95^n/128^n. (I wrote 2^40-1 because we shouldn't count the one 
  correct key. However, clearly that 1 is negligible for the purpose of computing, 
  so now I will drop it.) I get unicity distance by setting this equal to 1 and 
  solving for n. I get 92.993 characters as the answer. If you have 50 characters 
  of ciphertext, then you can expect to get (2^40)*(95/128)^50 = 368877 acceptable 
  sequences. You have essentially no chance of determining which one is correct. 
  If you have 140 characters of ciphertext, then you can expect to get (2^40)*(95/128)^140 
  = 0.000000819 false sequences--this means less than one chance in a million 
  that a false sequence will show up, so you can almost certainly determine which 
  message is correct.</P>

<P>Now suppose you are transmitting ascii characters again, and now the plaintext 
  is English and suppose again the the decryption device puts out 7-bit characters. 
  Consider a sequence of n characters. Now we know that there are 128^n possible 
  sequences that might come out of the decrypter. How many English sequences? 
  I gave you some notes that indicate that you should use 2^(nH), and H should 
  be in the range of 1.0 to 1.5. Let us use 1.3--I believe that is the value that 
  Schneier chose to use. Again let's use 40-bit keys. Then the formula for the 
  expected number of false sequences is (2^40)*(2^1.3n)/(128^n) = (2^40)*(2^1.3n)/(2^7*n) 
  = 2^(40-5.7n). Unicity distance is where 40-5.7n = 0, or n = 7.0175. This indicates 
  that you don't need much more than 7 symbols of ciphertext to break the code 
  (but it still may require a lot of computing). (Double that--14 characters, 
  is probably plenty to be safe.)</P>

<H3>Unicity Distance Assignment</H3>

<P>Assume that you send the 27 characters, 26 capital letters and space, and assume 
  that the code is a simple substitution code, where any letter my be substituted 
  for any letter, i. e. any letter may represent a, any letter except that one 
  may represent b, any letter except those two my be used to represent c, etc. 
  The ciphertext will be a string of capital letters and spaces, and the output 
  of the decipherer will also be a string of capital letters and spaces. The plaintext 
  is plain English, all letters upper case, keeping spaces.</P>
<P>I calculated the unicity distance as follows: There are K=27! keys, N=27^n 
  possible sequences of length n of which about M=2^(1.3n) look like English. 
  Thus the expected number of sequences, aside from the correct one, that we would 
  expect to find would be 27!*(2^(1.3n))/27^n. I solved for the value of n that 
  would make this expression equal to 1 and found the value to be about 27 characters. 
  (This is not exactly correct, because with a given string of ciphertext, the 
  decoder must decode into a sequence such that same characters in the cipher 
  text must go into the same character in the deciphered text. However, I believe 
  it is approximately correct.)</P>

<P>1a) Try to find cleartext that the following might decode into.</P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">OXRYJBRBKZR</FONT></TT></P>

<P>That is, find (part of) a substitution cipher such that this string deciphers 
  into a string that could be part of some English text. It may start and/or end 
  in the middle of a word. For a substitution cipher, this is too short. There 
  must be many such strings. For example this could decode into &quot;WEARS A 
  COA(T)&quot; if we encipher R into A, B into space, and the others in the obvious 
  way. However, this is not what I enciphered. I expect each student to find a 
  different string like this. It will be interesting to see whether anyone finds 
  the original plaintext that I used. Clearly you can't cryptanalyze a substitution 
  code with only this much ciphertext.Note that this is only about half as long 
  as the unicity distance.</P>

<P>1b) Try to decipher this string, which was enciphered using a different
substitution cipher.</P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">URJQQNOAGNTQQSNANIQOJQUNB NUVWNW NURQFNAJQNKQAK</FONT></TT></P>

<P>Let me give you several suggestions. First, here is a table of letter
frequencies. (These are expressed in percentages.)</P>

<PRE>A  8.0   B  1.5   C  3.0   D  4.0   E 13.0   F  2.0   G  1.5
H  6.0   I  6.5   J  0.5   K  0.4   L  3.5   M  3.0   N  7.0
O  8.0   P  2.0   Q  0.2   R  6.5   S  6.0   T  9.0   U  3.0
V  1.0   W  1.5   X  0.3   y  1.6   Z  0.1</PRE>

<P>This ignores spaces. I believe that the average word size is roughly 5, so 
  we would expect one character out of 6, or about 16%, to be spaces, depending 
  somewhat on whether the writer tends to use short or long words. There are no 
  double spaces in this ciphertext. There are tables of frequencies of digraphs, 
  also--if I run across one I will at least give you a reference. A digraph is 
  a pair of letters next to each other Several digraphs occur more than once in 
  this ciphertext. For example, UR occurs twice, as does Space-N and JQ occurs 
  three times, and also QQ occurs twice. You know, I think, what digraphs are 
  very common. What you have to do is to make an educated guess, based on frequencies 
  in the ciphertext and what you know about frequencies and good common sense. 
  If you make a wrong guess, things won't work out and you have to backtrack and 
  try a different guess. I think you should be able to do this in an hour or so--don't 
  spend much more than that on it.</P>

<P>This is about twice the unicity distance. I believe that in this case there 
  is probably no substitution that deciphers this string into a string that resembles 
  English except the one that I used to encipher it. (These two examples were 
  enciphered from English plaintext using two different substitution ciphers.) 
</P>

<P>Find the unicity distance for the following situations. For 2), 3), and 4) 
  assume that you are using DES, which has a 56-bit key. (Then how many possible 
  keys are there?)</P>
<P>2) Assume that you send bytes, and the information is decimal digits packed 
  two digits per byte. Any sequence of digits would be accepted. Find the unicity 
  distance in bytes. (Each hex digit is used to represent one decimal digit, and 
  thus the hex representation has no letters, only digits.)</P>

<P>3) Assume that you send bytes and you will accept any sequence of ascii
characters as a valid message. Find the unicity distance in bytes. (Assume
that there are 128 ascii characters, all of the characters with the first
bit equal to zero.)</P>

<P>4) Assume that you send bytes and the clear text is plain English, one letter 
  per byte. Find the unicity distance in bytes. Assume 1.3 bits per letter for 
  plain English.</P>

<P>5) Same as 4), but now assume triple DES with three different keys.</P>
<P>6) Same as 4), but now assume AES, which enciphers and deciphers 128-bit blocks. 
  It can use 128-bit or 192-bit or 256-bit keys. Let us assume 256-bit keys. Give 
  the answer for unicity distance in bytes.</P>
<P>7) Assume that you send bytes and the clear text is plain English, one letter 
  per byte, but before enciphering you compress it to half its uncompressed size. 
  Assume 1.3 bits per letter for the uncompressed English. Assume AES again with 
  256-bit keys, as in 6). Find the unicity distance in bytes.</P>
<p></p>
<P>Hint: The best way to approach this is to note that the amount of information
in the compressed message is the same as before compression, but there are
half as many bytes. Therefore the information per symbol of the compressed
text is twice the information per symbol of the uncompressed text. If we
assume 1.3 bits per symbol for the plain English, then there nust be about
2.6 bits per symbol for the compressed English. Another way of looking at
it that gives the same answer is to say that the number of acceptable compressed
messages of length n is approximately the same as the number of plain English
messages of length 2n, because a compressed message would be accepted if
it becomes plain English when expanded. (That is only approximately true,
because the ratio of compression is not exactly the same for every message,
but it gives the right result--the same as the other approach.) Either way
the number of compressed English messages of length n will be 2^(1.3*2*n).</P>

<P>Answers to problem 3: 56 bytes, and to problem 4: 8.36 bytes. Note that compression 
  makes cryptanalysis harder. You need more ciphertext. Also, you have to do more 
  computing, because you will probably have to decompress in order to recognize 
  whether the deciphered block is part of a compressed file than to recognize 
  whether it is plain English or not. </P>
