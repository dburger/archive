<h2>Unit 2--DES</h2>
<p>I would like to have you read the following, without trying to get a thorough 
  understanding of details: Chapter 12. DES, pages 357-363 Triple DES, Chapter 
  9 Modes of Operation, pages 191-193 Block Replay.</p>
<p>I will give you the program that I wrote to do DES enciphering and deciphering, 
  and I want you to program the 8-bit CFB mode, encipher and decipher. I will 
  give you some ciphertext and I want you to decipher it and send me your program 
  and the cleartext result that you get. (This can be a very simple program, roughly 
  half a page.)</p>
<p>I used as key, the hex number 843d0d08 34b2c4fa; and as the initial vector,<br>
  cd647403 bc90c4c4; and the ciphertext is</p>

  DES has been the most widely used encryption algorithm since it was first adopted 
  as a standard in 1975. In 1987, it was considered increasingly likely that DES 
  could be broken and it was not recertifiied, but no replacement was certified 
  in its place. It is still being used now, although it has been broken. See <i>http://www.eff.org/descracker/</i> 
  for details--it took 3 days with a computer built especially for breaking DES.) 
  It is still safe for most purposes. The simplest way to break it seems to be 
  to try all keys and see what you get. If you get something that looks like a 
  message, you accept it. The key is 56 bits, so there are 2^56 keys. It takes 
  a lot of computing to check that many keys, and for most purposes, it isn't 
  worth that much effort. However, every year computers become more powerful and 
  more plentiful, and it really is time to change. Now NIST (The National Institute 
  for Standards and Technology) is in the process of adopting a new standard. 
  I want to have you program that algorithm, and maybe it is time not to do DES. 
  However, you should know about DES. Please read Chapter 12. Do not spend time 
  on details--just aim for a feeling about what kind of algorithm this is. In 
  particular, the section on Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis is difficult. 
  (If you really want to understand that, let me give you something different 
  to read.) To me, the important point there is that you need a lot of ciphertext 
  to even try those methods, because they are based on a very subtle statical 
  analysis. No one should, and probably no one does, make a lot of ciphertext 
  with one kkey, and therefore those cryptanalysis methods are not practical threats. 
  Other than the statistical analysis on which differential cryptanalysis and 
  linear cryptanalysis are based, I don't know of any interesting theory about 
  DES. There is a theorem that says that if you complement every bit in the key 
  and the cleartext, then every bit <br>
  in the ciphertext is complemented, also. A few weak keys ahve been found. That 
  is all, although DES has been studied long and hard. </p>
<p>There are a number of other symmetric algorithms that similarly have no appreciable 
  supporting theory. They are probably strong, but they haven't been studied as 
  hard as DES, so users are reluctant to trust them. The new AES certainly will 
  be used and studied, but it seems to be in the same class--very little theory. 
  I want to look at it carefully in class. However, it will be better to have 
  more math background first.</p>
<p>The DES algorithm has as input a 56-bit key and a 64-bit piece of cleartext, 
  and the output is a 64-bit piece of ciphertext. (Actually, you give it a 64-bit 
  key, but it simply ignores every eighth bit--the original idea was to use those 
  as parity checks on bytes for error detection.) Now commercial users that are 
  not satisfied with des are using &quot;triple des&quot;. In triple des, you 
  encipher using a key, k1, then decipher using k2, and encipher again using k3. 
  Of course the second step simply acts like enciphering, since you are not using 
  the key that would decipher. At first, it was recommended that k1 and k3 be 
  the same, but I believe it is more common now to use three different keys, so 
  the key is essentially 3*56 = 168 bits. This is thought to be secure with present 
  technology. Triple DES is discussed in Schneier on pages 357-363.</p>
<p>I want you to understand &quot;modes of operation&quot;. (This is discussed 
  in Chapter 9 of Schneier's book.) The obvious mode is called ECB (Electronic 
  Code Book). You divide your ciphertext into blocks of 8 bytes (64 bits) and 
  encipher each block to get eight-byte blocks of ciphertext. This has a couple 
  of disadvantages. For one, it is relatively easy to cryptanalyze. You take a 
  block of ciphertext and try all keys. One key will give you cleartext, which 
  you can recognize as cleartext if it is really text, for example, orif it has 
  any distinct form that you can recognize. Other keys will probably give you 
  garbage. (We will look at this carefully when we study unicity distance.) This 
  is what was done when des was &quot;broken&quot;. It is not easy to break des, 
  but it is easier to break the ECB mode than the other modes. The other important 
  problem with ECB is &quot;block replay&quot;--see pages 191-193.</p>
<p>The description of des and the modes of operation in the textbook are a little 
  too concise for you to use for writing a program. I have given you the standard 
  document describing des modes of operation. That is not too clear, either, but 
  the block diagram is quite clear, I think, and the document gives some debug 
  output for each of the modes. Using that and the diagram, I believe that you 
  can understand what is required and write the program without great difficulty. 
  Do the case for the data that is given in that document first. If you can get 
  that correct, you should be able to decode what I gave you with no great difficulty. 
  My program for the des algorithm and for the ECB mode example given in the modes 
  of operation document are in my unix account at ~wes/ics623/des and you should 
  be able to copy them to your unix account and either write the program on unix 
  or download those files and work on the PC. If you use my des program, the rest 
  should be quite simple--half a page or so. </p>
<h3>Notes on Chapter 12: Section 12.1</h3>
<p>The history of DES is interesting and I think it will help give you some perspective 
  on the overall security problem. I have only two notes to add to this excellent 
  account of DES history. First, Prof. Alan Konheim, who is mentioned on page 
  266 as one of the original designers of DES, was a visiting professor in our 
  department spring 1999. The other is that DES has been broken. This made the 
  national news, although the accounts on the newscasts were not particularly 
  accurate. Here is an announcement that appeared on the internet and was forwarded 
  to me by a former student of ICS623:</p>
<p><i>Subject: DES cracked in 3 days</i></p>
<p><i>A DES encrypted message was cracked in 3 days using a custom-built hardware 
  cracker. See http://www.eff.org/descracker/ for more info and photos of the 
  machine.</i></p>
<p><i>Introduction</i></p>
<p><i>To prove the insecurity of DES, EFF built the first unclassified hardware 
  for cracking messages encoded with it. On Wednesday of this week the EFF DES 
  Cracker, which was built for less than $250,000, easily won RSA Laboratory's 
  &quot;DES Challenge II&quot; contest and a $10,000 cash prize. It took the machine 
  less than 3 days to complete the challenge, shattering the previous record of 
  39 days set by a massive network of tens of thousands of computers. The research 
  results are fully documented in a book published this week by EFF and O'Reilly 
  and Associates, entitled &quot;Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption Research, 
  Wiretap Politics, and Chip Design.&quot;</i></p>
<p>The book is a little contraversial. Good encryption can keep foreign countries' 
  secrets out of the NSA's hands. It can also keep terrorists' and criminals' 
  plans and communications secret. Hence the NSA and the FBI would prefer that 
  they be the only ones having good encryption techniques. I can understand that. 
  There are a couple of problems, however. In the first place, good encryption 
  techniques are now known throughout the world. The content of Schneier's book 
  is public information, and almost none of that information came from the NSA 
  or any other secret source. Many important developments have been done by scientists 
  in foreign countries. The second problem is that good security is needed in 
  ordinary commercial applications. The NSA has been hampering efforts to make 
  secure commercial equipment in the United States and even more, for equipment 
  intended for export. They have little influence outside the US, and therefore 
  foreign competetors are free to make secure systems. That puts U. S. industry 
  at a competetive disadvantage. Because of this, regulations have been loosened 
  considerably lately. It is possible now to get a licence to export strong encryption.</p>
<p>I must confess that I am not neutral on these matters. I have nothing to hide, 
  but still I am very uncomfortable with the idea of having the federal government 
  prevent me from sending a message to someone that they cannot read. Now we are 
  free to use systems like PGP, which the NSA in all likelihood cannot break. 
  I hope it will stay that way.</p>
<h3>Section 12.2</h3>
<p>Don't try to understand the details. Just try to understand what kind of algorithm 
  it is that they are using. Think a little about how hard it might be to decipher.</p>
<h3>Scetion 12.3</h3>
<p>Now you know that DES can be broken, and you know about how hard it is. It 
  is still interesting to compare these comments on security with what we know 
  has been done. I think it is interesting to check the arithmetic on some of 
  these guys' calculations.</p>
<p>1) The cost of the machine that EFF used to crack DES is consistant with the 
  data in Table 7.1 on page 153. That is closer than most estimates I have seen.</p>
<p>2) Let's estimate how long it would take to break DES on your new computer 
  assuming you have one block of known plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext. 
  We will assume the brute force method--you simply try to decode it with every 
  possible key and see which one works. There are 2^56 keys. (I will use ^ to 
  mean exponentiation, so this means 2 to the power 56.) The figures in the book 
  indicate that it is possible to decipher 43,000 blocks per second for an intel 
  486-66. Maybe your new computer can work about ten times that fast, so let's 
  estimate 2^19 = 524288 deciphers per second. (Actually I suspect that the figure 
  given by Schneier is how fast you can decode after you have calculated the 16 
  keys K1-K16, whereas with a different key for each step it will take longer.) 
  So you will need 2^56/2^19 = 2^37 seconds. That comes out to about 4358 years.Of 
  course, you can quit when you get a match, and on the average that would take 
  you half that much time. You can reduce that time by a) using special DES deciphering 
  hardware, b) using a faster computer, or c) using computers in parallel, or 
  some combination. The machine actually used to break DES apparently used a lot 
  of DES chips working in parallel and controlled by the main computer.</p>
<p>3) Let's look at Hellman's proposal (p 289). This is a chosen-plaintext attack. 
  He assumes he can always get the ciphertext for a certain plaintext block, and 
  from that he wants to get the key. For every key K he computes the ciphertext 
  C and then he stores the key in a table: Table[C] = K. After he has the table, 
  he can find any key from the ciphertext for his chosen block by simply looking 
  in the table for it. In the first place, it will take considerable time to make 
  the table. If you do it on your PC, it will take a few thousand years, so you 
  would need a good computer to do that. Then, let's see how much disk space you 
  need and how much it might cost. For each of the 2^56 keys, you need to store 
  8 = 2^3 bytes, so the total is 2^59. Roughly there are 2^30 bytes in a gigabyte. 
  (Note that 1000 is approximately 2^10.) So we need 2^59/2^30 =2^29 gigabytes, 
  That is about 500,000,000 gigabytes, and if we estimate $10 per gigabyte, the 
  cost would be about $5 billion. It wouldn't be easy to build a machine like 
  that, either.</p>
<h3>Section 12.4</h3>
<p>Read this section but don't worry about understanding it at all well. Differential 
  cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis are quite difficult concepts, and I don't 
  want to take the time for us to understand them well. They apply only to cryptosystems 
  that are similar to DES. It seems to be important that DES was designed so that 
  they are minimally effective. However, because that is true, these techniques 
  cannot find a key any easier than a brute-force attack, i. e. trying all keys. 
  Furthermore, to apply these techniques you need a lot of ciphertext--see Table 
  12.14 on page 289. Schneier points out that the ciphertext you need to do differential 
  cryptanalysis amounts to about 3 years of data at 1.5 megabytes per second. 
  In practice, a key is used for a session, which generally will amount to anywhere 
  from a fraction of a second to maybe an hour. How much ciphertext do you need 
  to do a brute-force attack? That is the next subject we will study.</p>
