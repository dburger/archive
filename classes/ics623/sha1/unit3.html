<h2>Unit 3--Hash Functions</h2>
<p>This may not be the logical place for this topic by most reasoning, but it 
  is important and it is a topic that we can discuss without more mathematical 
  preparation, so let's do it now. I would like you to study this note and the 
  sections of the book that are referenced, and also to program the SHA1 standard 
  hash algorithm. I will give some further details on the SHA1 program in these 
  notes </p>
<p>A hash function is a function H(s), where s is a string of bits of any length 
  and the function value is a number in a specified range--usually a 128 or 160 
  bit number in cryptographic applications. In general, for a good hash function, 
  you want all possible function values to be about equally probable if you choose 
  an s at random. Let us assume that our hash function produces an n bit number. 
  Then the probability that two randomly chosen strings s1 and s2 will have the 
  same hash value is about 1 in 2^n. Here are some ways in which you can make 
  good use of hash functions:<br>
</p>
<p>A) Error detection. When you transmit or store some data, you store its hash 
  value with it. When you receive or recall the information, you recalculate the 
  hash value. If the recalculated value doesn't match the hash value sent or stored 
  with the data, you have detected an error. If there is an error, the probability 
  will be about one in 2^n that the correct data and the erroneous data will have 
  the same hash value, so the probability of an undetected error is about 1 in 
  2^n.</p>
<p>B) Do files match? Suppose you have a file in your PC and a &quot;copy&quot; 
  of it on one of the Sun servers. Are those files the same? You can't compare 
  them, because they are in different computers. If you send the file from one 
  computer to the other, you can't be sure that the file you received is the same 
  as the one you sent. There might be a transmission error, or the ftp program 
  may even introduce changes. What you can do is to calculate the hash function 
  of each file and compare them. If the files are different, the probability is 
  about one in 2^n that the hash values will match. </p>
<p>For the purpose of A) and B), n=32 is prbobably quite adequate. This gives 
  a probability of one in several billion that you will have an undetected error. 
  That is about the same as the probability that you will be killed the next time 
  you cross the street. Most of you seem willing to bet your life with those odds. 
  For the following cryptographic applications, n=64 is not adequate. Using n=128 
  seems to be adequate. Now n=160 is quite common.</p>
<p>C) The basic concept of a digital signature is as follows: To sign a message 
  M, you encrypt M using your private key. Then anyone can decrypt using your 
  public key. If your public key decrypts the message properly with your public 
  key, it must have ben encrypted with your private key. Then you must have sent 
  it, because no one else could possibly have encrypted it because no one else 
  knows your private key. </p>
<p>Encrypting a big message with a public key is slow. A much more efficient method 
  is to calculate H(M) and then encrypt that value, which will be 128 or 160 bits, 
  using your private key. You send M and with it the encrypted hash value. The 
  person who wants to verify your signature simply decrypts the hash value and 
  recalculates H(M) from the message, and compares those values, and if they are 
  equal, he/she assumes that you must have sent the message.</p>
<p>D) Storiing passwords securely. It is best not to store passwords in the computer 
  as clear text, because if a hacker gets access to the files, he has all the 
  passwords. What is done is that the hash of the passwords is stored. When you 
  change your password, the computer calculates the hash and stores it. When you 
  login, the computer again calculates the password and compares with the stored 
  hash value. If the hash values match, you are accepted. Actually, the computer 
  administrators do not know your password. I believe that unix uses a hash function 
  based on DES.</p>
<p>E) Here is a new way to handle copyrights. Instead of having the copyright 
  office store a copy of your document, you send them the hash value and they 
  store it, which is much more economical. If anyone contests your copyright, 
  you simply show the original document. That person can recalculate the hash 
  function. If it matches the hash function that you registered, that proves that 
  you had that document at the time of the copyright registration.</p>
<p>For C), D), and E) you need stronger requirements on the hash function (see 
  pp. 429-431)</p>
<p>Let h = H(M) be the hash value for a message M. Then</p>
<p>1) Given M, it should be easy to calculate h. </p>
<p>2) Given h it should be hard (practically impossible) to calculate M such that 
  h = H(M)</p>
<p>3) Given M it should be hard (practically impossible) to calculate another 
  message M1 such that H(M1) = H(M). (This is equivalent to 2).</p>
<p>4) It should be hard (practically impossible) to find two messages M1 and M2 
  such that H(M1) = H(M2).</p>
<p>If you could do 2) you could do forgery. You could find a message that Alice 
  signed and then replace the message with a different message that would still 
  match her signature. If you could do 4), then you could have Alice sign M1 and 
  then use that signature with M2 to claim that Alice signed M2. Study the protocol 
  on page 430 to see how this might be done if the hash function is not strong 
  enough. Also, see the discussion of the &quot;birthday attack&quot; on pages 
  165-166. I will discuss that in class in some more detail.</p>
<p>For A) and B), you could use a CRC (cyclic redundanncy check, used for error 
  detection) or treating M as a binary number, use M mod p for some large prime 
  number. However, they are not secure hash functions. They do not satisfy requirements 
  2), 3), or 4) above. What you should use is an algorithm designed for the purpose 
  of hashing. There are several. I don't think any is better than the algorithm 
  SHA1 that has been adopted as a standard quite widely. The book describes SHA. 
  SHA1 is a revised algorithm almost identical to SHA. I will give you a copy 
  of one of the standards documents. That document has adequate information for 
  writing a program and checking it. It has several asmple calculations. </p>
<p>Specifically, your assignment is to write a program that will calculate the 
  SHA1 hash of a file. Do it in such a way, however, that later you can calculate 
  the hash of a string of bytes in memory, because we will implement a couple 
  of signature algorithms later in the course. You may assume that the file is 
  no larger than one megabyte, if you wish. SHA1 actually deals with 512 bit blocks 
  of data. It is possible to write your program in such a way that it reads 512 
  bit blocks one at a time and processes them, and thus your program may be able 
  to calculate the hash for a file with no size limit. Assuming the file size 
  is no greater than one megabyte, so that you can read the whole file into memory 
  before you process, simplifies the process. Doing it for the case where there 
  is no restriction on the file size is an interesting challenge.</p>
<p>Here is the output from my program for several files. Use your program to compute 
  these and see whether you get the same hash values as I did. The first three 
  are the examples given in the standard document. All six files are in my unix 
  directory ~wes/ics/sha1 and you should be able to copy them from there.</p>

<p>For programs for this course, you have to be aware of a little problem related 
  to data representation in the computer. See the note <a href="Endian.html">&quot;Little 
  Endian--Big Endian&quot;.</a></p>
