============================================================================
My program works perfectly with the testselect program.

I have also tested my program with about 5 different web browsers.  You can
find some information on a couple of interesting problems that I ran into and
the manner in which I fixed them below.  In summary my program seems to work
perfectly with all the browsers except for one small glitch that occurs very
rarely with Netscape 6.1.  In very rare cases a file that is usually proxied
perfectly will not work correctly.  The result will be just the ip address
(http://128.171.44.7:2000/index.html for example) showing up in the browser
window.  This is a problem that I researched very thoroughly.  I looked at
the headers that were being proxied in the case of a successful send versus a
failed send and found them to be identical.  I then looked at the recv/
send loop in the proxy process and determined that for some reason Netscape 6.1
was not accepting data midway through the proxy process.  No other browser
exhibited this behaviour and Netscape 6.1 did this only very rarely and on the
same page that would be sent perfectly most of the time.

2 Interesting problems that I fixed for those that are interested:
============================================================================
1.  Originally my program had a problem when trying to send images back to the
client.  This only occurred on my home computer and only with jpegs.  I
wrestled with this bug for many hours until I discovered that a third party
program that I was running in the background called AdSubtract was causing the
problem.  As soon as I shut down AdSubtract this behavior disappeared.
AdSubtract is a filtering program that removes advertisements from web pages.
I am not sure why it interfered with my proxy server and with jpegs in 
particular.

2.  When I began to test my program with Netscape 4.7 I noticed that a couple
of the pages would not load completely into that browser.  This is another
problem that I tried to track down for several hours.  After a lot of work I
stumbled upon this web site:

http://www.peacefire.org/bypass/Proxy/akamai.html

This web site explained that Netscape 4.7 has a bug in dealing with web pages
that have references to .css or .js files that don't exist.  Netscape 4.7
refuses to render pages if the associated .css or .js file doesn't exist.  Thus
my proxy server, which wasn't designed to proxy .css or .js files, would
result in a page that wouldn't load.  The website said that the solution was
to turn off javascript and cascading style sheets in the browser.  I thought
this was a bad solution for my proxy server so I set it up so that the proxy
server would send a "fake," and pretty much empty .css or .js file to the
client so that Netscape 4.7 would be happy with my proxy server regardless of
whether the user had shut off javascript and cascading style sheets.
