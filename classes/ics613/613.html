Assignment 4 - PageCheck<br />
ICS 613, Dr. Johnson<br />
David J. Burger<br />
09/07/2003

<hr />

I have completed V1 - V5 of the PageCheck subtasks.  The final version
of the program that I am submitting is V5, the get creative subtask.
<p />

After completing subtasks V1 - V4 I wasn't entirely satisified with
the functionality of the program.  The reason was that many web
servers do not return the header corresponding to the last
time the page was modified.  This made the program return the Unix
epoch, Jan. 1, 1970, as the last modified date for these pages.  This
made the program ineffectual for many web pages depending on the
configuration of the hosting web server.  Interestingly enough the web
server which hosts the www2.hawaii.edu domain does not return this
header and therefore I couldn't use my original PageCheck program on
my own web pages.
<p />

I decided to resurrect an idea I had used in a Perl program that
checks for changes in web pages by storing the algorithmic hash of the
contents of the web page and then compares that hash to the latest
hash when the program is run again.  This avoids the problem with the
last modified header not being supplied and can therefore be applied
to a wider range of web pages.
<p />

It was interesting to write this program in Java, as my Java version
relies on the extensive class libraries while my Perl version pipes
data through other programs (such as md5sum for the hash and mail for
mailing).
<p />

So in summary my V5 version:<br />
<ul>
  <li>accepts command line input of one or more files</li>
  <li>each file contains PageCheck job information that can specify
  multiple urls to check with multiple recipients</li>
  <li>changes are indicated by a change in the algorithmic hash</li>
</ul>

I have tried to think of all the exceptional conditions that can exist
and program accordingly.  These include:
<p />

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>problem</td><td>reaction</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>input file or files not provided</td>
    <td>program outputs proper usage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>input file cannot be read</td>
    <td>program outputs message</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>input file not in correct format / missing data</td>
    <td>program displays what is missing from the input file</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data file not in correct format</td>
    <td>program outputs message</td>
  <tr>
    <td>url cannot be fetched</td>
    <td>programs sends failed: url in message</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hash data cannot be saved</td>
    <td>message includes failure to save new hash values</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p />

Of course the only true test of this would be to have a substantial
number of users bang on the program for a while.

If you have any questions or problems with the assignment submission,
please let me know.  (Especially with that zip file, Linux zip seems
a little quirky.)
