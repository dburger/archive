Chapter 3-4 Quiz

1.  A deque is:  a queue like data structure that supports insertion and deletion at both the front 
and rear of the queue.

2.  A tack is an appropriate data structure when information must be saved and later retrieved 
using which of the following orderings:  reverse.

3.  Which stack operations have the same order of magnitude in the array and linked list 
implementation?  all (pop(), top(), push(), size(), isEmpty())

4.  The queue operation dequeue() does the following:  removes and returns the item at the front.

5.  If a string of characters in enqueued onto a queue and then dequeued, which of the follow is 
true?  the characters will be removed in the same order they were put on.

6.  What is the Big-Oh complexity of the standard recursive factorial function:  O(n)

7.  Which of the following are true?
The vector class will store any instantiated object given to it, even objects of different classes.
Performing a cast forces an object to be viewed as a member of a specific class rather than its 
more general superclass.

8.  Papers turned in on a teachers desk and graded from the top down are like a:   Stack.
Signing up for courses via UHMICS@hawaii.edu is like a:  Queue

9.  Given the following stack operations:  push(n), push(I), push(M), pop(), push(N), push(A), 
pop(), pop(), push(A), push(O), pop(), push®, push(A), pop().
What is popped from the stack in order?  MANOA

10.  What is left in the stack top down?  RAIN

11.  Given the following queue operations:  enqueue(W), enqueue(H), dequeue(), enqueue(A), 
dequeue(), enqueue(T), enqueue(F), dequeue(), enqueue(U), enqueue(N), enqueue(!), dequeu().
What is dequeued in order?  WHAT

12.  What is left in the queue, front to back?  FUN!

13.  Given the following operational frequencies, what Sequence implementation would be best?
10% insertElemAtRank, 10% removeElemAtRank, 80% elemAtRank:  array based

15.  Given the following operational frequencies, what Sequence implementation would be best?
30% insertFirst, 30% insertLast, 30% insertAfter, 10% elemAtRank:  list based
