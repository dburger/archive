<h2>Finding Large Prime Numbers</h2>
<p>First, at various points in the text and other writing on security, 
    you will find statements that ask you to find a prime number 
    satisfying certain conditions. With a little thought, you 
    can go about it a little differently from what the statement 
    suggests and make life a lot easier for yourself. Here are 
    some examples:</p>
<p>&quot;Choose a prime P = 2a+1 such that a is also prime.&quot; It is far easier 
  to choose a first, and then calculate P = 2a+1 and see whether that is prime 
  also.</p>
<p>&quot;Choose a prime P = 2ab+1, where a is a large prime.&quot; Choose a first, 
  and then try various choices for b until you find one for which P = 2ab+1 is 
  prime.</p>
<p>If you are going to have to factor phi(p) = p-1, then if you choose p first 
  and try to factor you won't succeed. On the other hand, if you choose factors 
  first and then multiply them together to get a, and set p = 2a+1, then you can 
  check whether p is prime.</p>
<p>In particular, in looking for a prime number, first choose s and then let p 
  = 2s+1 and check whether p is prime. That is easier than choosing p first and 
  then calculating s.</p>
<h2>Lehman Method for Testing for Primality</h2>
<p>I recommend using the Lehman test for prime numbers. The Lehman test is simple 
  and I believe at least as fast as any presented in the text. Most people seem 
  to think the Rabin test is better. I am convinced that the Lehman test is faster 
  and simpler and just as reliable. If you want to test whether n = 2s+1 is a 
  prime, you calculate b = x^s for a number of &quot;randomly chosen&quot; numbers 
  x. (I have been trying ten values of x that are small prime numbers.) If all 
  the resulting values are 1 or -1, but they are not all 1, then you accept n 
  as a prime. </p>
<p>If n is a prime, then x^(n-1) =1. Let b = x^((n-1)/2). Then 
    b^2- 1 = 0. In any field, this equation has exactly two solutions, 
    and they must be 1 and -1. If b is not either 1 or -1, then 
    n is not prime. What happens if n is not prime? One rare possibility 
    is that you always get 1. I will show that otherwise if n 
    is not prime, then for at least half the possible value of 
    x, x^((n-1)/2) is neither 1 nor -1, and thus if you try enough 
    values of x it is very unlikely that you will not discover 
    that n is not prime.</p>
<p>I have never found a large number n for which for one x, x^((p-1)/2) 
    = 1 or -1 and yet n was not prime. At least earlier versions 
    of PGP simply calculated x^(p-1) for one x, and if the result 
    was 1, they assumed that n was a prime. However, I think it 
    is prudent to be more careful than that. There do exist numbers 
    n called Carmichael numbers that have the property that x^(n-1) 
    = 1 mod n for all x and yet they are not prime. They are called 
    Carmichael numbers. They are rare, althoug it has been proven 
    that there are an infinite number of them. The smallest one 
    is 561 = 3*11*17. Carmicahel lists several of them in his 
    research paper on the subject. He shows that they have at 
    least three factors. Those are the only ones I have seen. 
    I guess I have tested a few million numbers for primality 
    and have never come across one. There may exist non-prime 
    numbers n for which x^((n-1)/2) = 1 for all x, and hence the 
    precaution of accepting a number n as prime only if values 
    of x are found for which x^((n-1)/2) is in some cases -1. 
    I will give a proof that if n is not prime and if values of 
    x occur for which x^((n-1)/2) is 1 and is -1, then at least 
    half the possible values of x will give other values, too. 
    Then if n is not prime and if you try k randomly chosen values 
    of x, the probability is at least 1 - 2^(-k) that you will 
    get other values besides 1 and -1. By choosing k large, you 
    may make this probability as near to 1 as you wish. In fact, 
    a very careful analysis of the problem shows that if n is 
    not a prime, even if 1 and -1 occur as values of x^((n-1)/2), 
    many more than half the values of x will give other values 
    than 1 and -1.</p>
<p>Let me give a proof. I will try to keep it simple. First, let us consider the 
  possiblilty that n = p^m. Then we know phi(n) = (p-1)*p^(m-1). n-1 = p^k - 1 
  is divisible by p-1, but since p^k-1 is not divisible by p, the GCD((n-1)/2, 
  phi(n)/2) is (p-1)/2. This group is cyclic, so there is an element, say a, that 
  is primitive. All the elements of the group are powers of a, and a^phi(n) = 
  1 and no smaller power of a is equal to 1. Actually, a^(phi(n)/2) = -1. If x 
  = a^(i*p^(m-1)) then x^(n-1) = 1 and x^((n-1)/2) is 1 or -1, but those are the 
  only values of x for which that is true. These are only a fraction 1/(p^(m-1)) 
  of the possible x. (This formula says that if m=1, then for all x, x^((n-1)/2) 
  = 1 or -1, which is correct, of course.)</p>
<p>Now suppose that n = a*b and a and b are relatively prime. (If n is not prime 
  and not a power of a prime, then there must exist such a and b.) Now suppose 
  that for some value of k, there exists x such that x^k = 1 and y such that y^k 
  = -1. What I am going to show is that there exist z and w such that z^k and 
  w^k are not either 1 or -1, and then we can conclude that the kth powers of 
  all elements cannot be more than half 1's and -1's. Suppose that x = x1 mod 
  a and x = x2 mod b and y = y1 mod a and y = y2 mod b. Then x1^k = 1 mod a and 
  x2^k = 1 mod b because x^k = 1 mod n. Also, y1^k = -1 mod a and y2^k = -1 mod 
  b, because we assumed that y^k = -1 mod n. Let z be the solution mod n of z 
  = x1 mod a and z = y2 mod b, and let w be the solution mod n of w = y1 mod a 
  and w = x2 mod b. Then z^k = 1 mod a and z^k = -1 mod b, and so z^k is not either 
  1 or -1 mod n. (If z^k = 1 mod n, then z^k = 1 mod a and z^k = 1 mod b, and 
  similarly, if z^k = -1 mod n, then z^k = -1 mod a and z^k = -1 mod b.) Similarly 
  w^k is not equal to 1 or -1. And thus of all possible values of x, no more than 
  half the values of x^k can be 1 or -1.</p>
<h2>Some Practical Suggestions</h2>
<p>First, generate a random number to use as s. Make the first and last bits 1, 
  so that you have a number with the right number of bits and it is odd. You can 
  do that with an or instruction, for example s[0] |= 1 for the low bit (assuming 
  little endian format). For the purposes of this class, I suggest just using 
  a random number generator.</p>
<p>(However, note that if Mallory wants to break into your system or find your 
  key, one approach he can use is to guess how you are generating random numbers 
  and finding prime numbers. Therefore, if you truly want a secure system, your 
  method of choosing random numbers as candidates for keys, etc. must be secure. 
  That is a very difficult problem. But note how PGP handled that.)</p>
<p>Probably that first random number will not make p = 2s+1 prime, so you need 
  another. You can generate another the same way. I don't see any problem in simply 
  adding 2 to the previous s, however. </p>
<p>First you choose s and then calculate p = 2s+1, and then you choose a number 
  x at random and calculate x^s mod p. I don't see a need for great security in 
  your choice of x. I made a list of ten three-digit prime numbers and used those 
  same ten numbers for all my tests, and that worked very satisfactorily. </p>
<p>To find a prime number p = 2s+1 for which s is also prime, I started by choosing 
  a 1021-bit number q, and set s = 2q+1 and tested s for primality. Then s would 
  be a 1022-bit number. Then each time I found a prime number s, I tried p = 2s+1. 
  Eventually I found some prime numbers of this form. Actually, I ran my program 
  on a 1 GHz. pentium for about 48 hours and found 8 prime numbers--an average 
  of six hours per prime number. One thing you will soon figure out is that you 
  don't want to start your program and get no output at all for six hours. You 
  want to know what is going on. What I did was to print a few characters each 
  time I tested a candidate. I printed the total number of candidates tested, 
  the total number of s's that were prime, and the total number of p = 2s+1 that 
  were found to be prime, and I also printed each prime number that I found, with 
  a note identifying it. </p>
<p>Almost all of the computing associated with each test is raising 
    x to the power q. My experience has been that if s = 2q+1 
    is not prime, this has to be done once, so usually that is 
    how long it takes for a test. On my 200 MHz computer, that 
    took about 2 seconds with my program. On the 1 GHz. computer, 
    it was about half a second. You should see whether your program 
    is consistant with that.</p>
<p>There is an approximate formula in number theory stating that the number of 
  prime numbers less than n is about n/ln(n). The number of 1023 or fewer bit 
  prime numbers is about 2^1023/ln(2^1023 = 2^1023/(1023*ln(2)). The number of 
  primes of 1022 digits or fewer is 2^1022/(1022*ln(2)). The difference is the 
  number of prime numbers of exactly 1023 bits. This is approximately (2^1023-2^1022)/(1023*ln(2)). 
  Since there are 2^1023-2^1022 numbers altogether, about one number in 1023*ln(2) 
  = 709 numbers is prime. You look at only the odd numbers, and half of the numbers 
  are even, so you should expect to find about one in 355 numbers that you test 
  to be prime. </p>
<p>How long is it going to take to find a value of s that is prime? 
    How long is it going to take to find a number p = 2s+1 such 
    that p and s are both prime? On my 200 Mhz computer, testing 
    one number required 4 seconds. On the average, I should find 
    one prime every 355 tests or every 4*355 = 1420 seconds, or 
    about 24 minutes. On the average, for one of every 355 of 
    those primes s, p = 2s+1 will also be prime. That will require 
    24*355 = 8520 minutes or about 142 hours. That is on Visual 
    C++ in debug mode. When I tell it to make a &quot;Release&quot; 
    version, it is twice as fast. On my other machine, each test 
    required about 0.5 second on the release version. That gets 
    the time down to about 18 hours. Estimate your time, and if 
    it is unreasonable, discuss it with me and we will find out 
    why your program is slower than mine and either change the 
    program or change the problem a little.</p>
<p>There is one other thing that you can do to speed things up. 
    You can divide by some of the smallest primes and eliminate 
    some of the candidates very quickly. Throwing away candidates 
    that are divisible by three eliminates 1/3 of the candidates, 
    and dividing by 5 eliminates 1/5 of the remaining ones, etc. 
    I divided by all the primes up to 31, and that eliminates 
    about 69% of the candidates very quickly. That reduces the 
    time required to 31% of what is required if I don't do that. 
    That is how I actually achieved an average of about 6 hours 
    per prime that I found. </p>
<p>Dividing a 1024-bit number by a small integer is not completely trivial, but 
  it can be done very efficiently. The computer divide instruction divides two 
  words by a single word and gives you a single word quotient and single word 
  remainder. You can use that instruction and the algorithm that you use for decimal 
  division by a single digit, but in the computer consider each word to be like 
  a digit. At the first step, use zero and the first word in the dividend as the 
  dividend for the divide instruction, and use your chosed divisor. store the 
  quotient and put the remainder followed by the next word as the next dividend 
  and divide. Store the quotiient, and repeat until you have done all the words. 
  (Try doing a decimal division with a one digit divisor and multiple digit dividend 
  to see how that works.) </p>
<p>I wrote an assembler language function for dividing a dividend consisting of 
  a word, r, plus 512 bits.</p>
<pre>int dd(UL *q, UL *dn, UL dv, UL r);
</pre>
<p>Here q is a pointer to the quotient, dn a pointer to the dividend, dv the value 
  of the one-word divisor, and r is the remainder to put in at the first step. 
  The resulting remainder is returned as the function value. Putting r in there 
  allows me to link this function for doing divisions for dividents of any multiple 
  of 512 bits. Thus, in my program, I divided by the first ten primes as follows:</p>
<pre>   for(j = 0; j&lt;10; j++) if(dd(u, P, prime[j], dd(u+16, P+16, prime[j], 0))==0) {<br>	   scount++;<br>	   return 0;<br>   }<br></pre>
<p>Here, I tried dividing by each of the first ten primes, which are in the array 
  prime[]. I counted how many times this eliminated a candidate using scount. 
  I found that the ratio of this to the total number of candidates tried was very 
  close to the theoretical value of 1-2/3*4/5*6/7*10/11*12/13*16/17*18/19*22/23*28/29*30/31 
  = 69%.</p>
<p>I have put dd.asm and dd.obj in my unix account, ~wes/ics623/longa.</p>
<p>Note:<br>
    (I sent this by email to everyone in ICS623 on November 4.)</p>
<p>1) Several students have asked me about dividing. You can do 
    Assignment 9 without dividing, and that is what I want you 
    to do. Also, I want you to do Assignment 9 without using Montgomery's 
    method-I want you to have that experience. After you make 
    the multiply and exponentiation functions work using only 
    the shift and add functions, then if you want to use Montgomery's 
    method, i. e. for doing other assignments including finding 
    prime numbers, that is fine.<br>
    If you make a mod n add function and a mod n shift function 
    and use them in your multiply function, and use that multiply 
    function in your exponentiation function, then you never have 
    to divide. Note that the add and shift functions do not need 
    to divide or do the C mod function--they need to subtract. 
    You will also need a mod n subtract function, which also doesn't 
    need any divide.<br>
    The SPARC processor does not have built-in integer multiply 
    and divide instructions. Therefore, I don't think that you 
    can gain any speed using Montgomery's method with that machine. 
    What Montgomery's method does for you is to make it possible 
    to use the power of the built-in multiply instruction to compute 
    faster.</p>
<p>2) I never said exactly what I would like you to do with respect 
    to finding prime numbers. I would like to have your find at 
    least one prime number that satisfies an additional condition. 
    Here are several possibilities:<br>
    1) Find a 1023-bit prime P = 2a+1 such that a is also prime. 
    (It is actually a little easier to find a prime a first and 
    then test 2a+1.)<br>
    2) Find a 1023-bit prime P = 2ab+1 such that a and b are large 
    primes.<br>
    3) Find a 1023-bit prime suitable for the Digital Signature 
    Algorithm. This requires a prime P = 2aq+1 where q is a 160-bit 
    prime. If you want to do it really correctly, follow the algorithm 
    on page 489. (For step 9) you can calculate X mod q using 
    the programs that you have by multiplying X by 1 mod q. X 
    has to be the multiplier, i. e. the one in which you test 
    each bit, determining whether to add or not, and when you 
    add, you add the 1.)<br>
    Finding a prime of type 1) will take the most time. Testing 
    one prime takes essentially the time to do exponentiation. 
    You can estimate that by looking at your watch while the program 
    is running. In the note on finding prime numbers, there is 
    an estimate of how many numbers you have to test. For 1023-bit 
    prime numbers, the average is 355 odd numbers. Of course you 
    can be lucky and find one soon, or you could be unlucky and 
    it could take much longer than that. If you want p = 2a+1 
    where a is also prime, you have to test on the average 355 
    candidates to find a suitable a, and you have to test 355 
    a's on the average to find a suitable p, and so you have to 
    do 355*355 tests on the average. That can take a lot of time. 
    For 2) if you generate a and b and then test p = 2ab+1, then 
    find a new a and new b and test the new 2ab+1, this will take 
    about the same amount of time as 1). However, if you do the 
    following, it is significantly faster. Generate a and b and 
    test p = 2ab+1. Then generate c and test 2ac+1 and 2bc+1. 
    Then generate d and test 2ad+1, 2bd+1, and 2cd+1, etc. For 
    3) find a suitable q and then you can use various randomly 
    chosen 1023-160 = 863-bit numbers for a. This would be fast. 
    Even using the algorithm on page 489 should be quite fast, 
    because SHA1 is fast. (Use SHA1, not the old SHA, if you do 
    this.)</p>
