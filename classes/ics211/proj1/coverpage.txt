Test case #1:

In test case number one the sample data from the problem in the book was used.  The 
following was the output of the program:

Bridge Hand Evaluator
Press enter on a blank line to quit.
Enter your bridge hand:
2C QD TC AD 6C 3D TD 3H 5H 7H AS JH KH

The hand entered was:
2C QD TC AD 6C 3D TD 3H 5H 7H AS JH KH
This is your hand sorted by suits:
Clubs           10      6       2
Diamonds        A       Q       10      3
Hearts          K       J       7       5       3
Spades          A
Points for hand = 16

Enter another bridge hand:

Thank you for using the bridge hand evaluator.

As you can see, the cards are correctly listed by suits in descending order.  The points are 
also correct as follows:

Attribute of Hand
Value
3 Clubs    0
4 Diamonds 0
5 Hearts   0
1 Spade    2
2 Aces     8
1 King     3
1 Queen    2
1 Jack     1
Total:    16

So the desk check checks out.


Test case #2:

In test case number two, I entered the data as follows and got the following result:

Bridge Hand Evaluator
Press enter on a blank line to quit.
Enter your bridge hand:
AS 5H 9C 2D QH AH JC KH 3C TS QS JH

The hand entered was:
AS 5H 9C 2D QH AH JC KH 3C TS QS JH
This is your hand sorted by suits:
Clubs           J       9       3
Diamonds        2
Hearts          A       K       Q       J       5
Spades          A       Q       10
Points for hand = 19

Enter another bridge hand:

Thank you for using the bridge hand evaluator.

Once again you can see that the cards have been correctly sorted by suit and are listed in 
descending order.  The points are also correct as follows:


Attribute of Hand
Value
3 Clubs    0
1 Diamonds 2
5 Hearts   0
3 Spades   0
2 Aces     8
1 King     3
2 Queens   4
2 Jack     2
Total:    19

So the desk check checks out.
