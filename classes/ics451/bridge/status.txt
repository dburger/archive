============================================================================
We have tested our bridge program under a variety of conditions and have
found it to be error free.  We tested it with as many as 6 bridges and over
20 interfaces.  We even tested it with 3 bridges running on uhunix connecting
to 3 bridges running on another server.

Our bridge uses a hash table for quick indexing into the host table.
Collisions are handled via chaining, that is, our hash function indexes
into an array of linked lists.
