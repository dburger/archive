This program runs in MIMD mode.  In order to get it to run that way on the
RS6000, in addition to the environment variables set as in the previous
program, you need to set:

export MP_PGMMODEL=mpmd

Also, to launch the program it is done like this:

poe -procs n

Then it will ask you which programs to put on which nodes, this program is
set up to put the manager on node zero (include the command line parameter
for the range), supervisor on node one, and worker on the rest of the nodes.

This program is not an example of optimization of finding primes, but is an
example of agenda parallelism using MIMD.

It works by having the manager first tell the supervisor the range for
determining primes which is sqrt(input).  Workers will request work from the
supervisor and the supervisor will hand out CHUNK_SIZE chunks to each worker.
When the worker finishes his chunk he passes the results back to the manager.
The manager uses these results to eliminate all multiples of the determined
primes in the entire input.  Workers then queue up for more work, and when
the work is depleted they receive a quit message.  After the supervisor has
sent all the workers a quit message he will send the manager a quit message.
The manager will then print out the determined primes.
