This is a very simple example of MPI used with SIMD.  To run the program you
need to type:

poe primes -procs n m

Where n is the number of processes to create, and m is the command line
parameter to the primes program.

It workers by having the last process act as a manager, dividing the m
array positions into slices for the other processes acting as workers.  Each
of the other processes determines which numbers are prime in its range and
then passes the results back to the manager process.  The manager process
collects this information and then prints the primes on the screen.

Here are instructions on what needs to be done on the IBM RS6000 to run
such a program.

1. Create an .rhosts file in your login directory containing the names of
the two controller nodes, in this case bh02n01 and bh02n02, on separate lines.

2. Create a host list file that contains each node that you would want to use
listed on separate lines.  In this case from bh01n01 to bh01n16 and also
bh02n03 to bh02n16 (must skip controller nodes).  Call this file .host.list
and drop it in your login directory.  Set up an environment variable to point
at this file:

export MP_HOSTFILE=~/.host.list

3.  If you like labeled ordered output, you can also add:

export MP_LABELIO=yes
export MP_STDOUTMODE=ordered
