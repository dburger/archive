ICS 451 Fall 2001 Final Exam 3, December 8th-December 21st.

This is a take-home final exam.  By University regulation, it is due
at 4:15pm on Friday, December 21st, but you are encouraged to turn it
in sooner if you so desire.

The exam must be mailed to esb@hawaii.edu in advance of that deadline.
If you mail it in more than 2 days before the deadline, please mail
only one copy -- the instructor will mail you back a copy (within 48
hours) that you can check to make sure it has been received correctly.
If you turn the exam in at any time on or after Dec 18th, please mail
two identical copies at least 10-15 minutes apart, and both of them
before the deadline, since if I don't get a submission on time, you
will fail the exam.  All emails must be plain text only, with no
attachments.

The exam is open-book (any book), open notes, and calculators are
allowed.  You are not allowed to use the web (except for the course
web pages, including any web page referred to by the project, and the
web pages for the textbook, and your own personal web pages) nor to
consult with your friends or anybody else.  That means there is no
talking about the exam with ANYBODY, from the moment you read this
email until after the final deadline on December 21st.  All the words
in your answer must be your own -- you may not quote the book or a web
page or anything.  Evidence of copying from somewhere else will be
sufficient cause for failing the entire exam.

I will not answer any questions about the exam -- if there is a
question that you think is unclear, please read it more carefully,
considering all possible interpretations, and if it is still unclear
or ambiguous for you, please simply give your best answer, stating
your assumptions if necessary.  Please double-check and spell-check
all your answers before turning in the exam.  All questions have the
same weight.  You are encouraged to keep your answers brief and to
the point, but without leaving out anything essential.

Good luck!



======================================================================
Question 1.

Using your own words, explain the TCP sliding window system:
- when does the left edge of the window move?
- when does the right edge of the window move?
- can both edges of the window move simultaneously?
  if yes, explain when that happens, if no, explain why not
- give the simplest possible formula for the number of bytes
  (call it B) that a TCP sender is allowed to send.  The
  formula may only use the variables specified in RFC 793.
  The formula must be of the form B = ..., where you replace
  the ... with the appropriate calculation.

======================================================================
Question 2.

A TCP connection is the state, stored at each end system, that
"remembers" information about the connection.  Using your own
words, explain how the three-way handshake initializes this
state.

======================================================================
Question 3.

When configuring a domain name server for an internet-connected
computer, I must specify the server's IP address, not its domain name.
- Why?
Usually, I also specify default search domains, for example
ics.hawaii.edu or hawaii.edu.
- How are these used?
- Which Unix system call takes an arbitrary domain name and
  returns one or more corresponding IP addresses?

======================================================================
Question 4.

When writing a quiz server, I had (at least) the following choices:
- write a standalone server to serve quizzes
- write a CGI program that will be called by a web server and
  serve the quizzes.
Compare the two approaches, specifying all the advantages and disadvantages
of one or the other.  Include one sentence for each advantage or disadvantage.

======================================================================
Question 5.

Design a reliable transmission system that does not use TCP.  At the
end of your design, analyze it and tell me how it detects and corrects for:
- missing packets
- duplicate packets
- errors in the packets
- mis-delivered packets
