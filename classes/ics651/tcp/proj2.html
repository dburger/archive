<p>
The goals of this project are:
<ol>
<li> to learn about signaling
<li> to learn about TCP connection establishment and teardown
<li> to become familiar with TCP header formats
</ol>

<p>This is an individual project.  You may discuss ideas with your
colleagues, but you must be the sole author of all your code.

<p>Your implementation must interoperate with the implementations of
at least 2 other people.  Your implementation must be in C and compile
and run on a Unix system.

<p>The project is due Sunday, March 24th 2002, at any time.
Submission is electronic:

<ol>
<li> all your code must be in a file named "tcp.c"
<li> cd to the directory containing your project file "tcp.c"
<li> run the command:
<tt>
/home/1/esb/turnin651
</tt>
<li> your file "tcp.c" must show, in a comment near the beginning:
<ol>
<li> your full name.
<li> whether you think your program works, and if not, what you think
the problem is.
<li> the full name of the people (if any) with whom you have seen your
code successfully interoperate.
</ol>
</ol>

No credit will be given for late submissions.

<p>Signaling is the management of connections by sending special
messages.  The assignment is to implement the TCP state machine for
connection establishment/teardown described starting on page 21 of the
TCP specification, <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">RFC
793</a>.  To simplify your task, you are not required to implement any
of the data transfer, retransmission, and window management operations
of TCP, only the connection establishmeent and teardown.

<h2>Project Specification</h2>

Your job is to implement a file, tcp.c, which must provide the
following functions:

<ol>

<li><tt>int tcp_connect(int local_IP, int IP_address, short local_port, short
remote_port)</tt> opens a connection to the specified IP address if
possible, returning -1 in case of failure (reset received, timeout,
destination unreachable).  If the connection succeeds, tcp_connect
returns a connection identifier, an integer in 1..10 representing the
connection.

<li><tt>int tcp_listen(int local_IP, short local_port, int * IP_address, int
timeout)</tt> listens for a connection, and if a connection succeeds,
fills in the IP address and returns the connection identifier.  If no
connection is received within the given timeout (in milliseconds), or
if the port is already in use for a different connection (or listen),
tcp_listen must return -1.

<li><tt>void tcp_close(int connection, int local_IP)</tt> closes the connection
specified by the argument.

<li><tt>void tcp_init()</tt>
is called exactly once, before any call to connect or listen or close.

</ol>

tcp.c may use the following functions:

<ol>

<li><tt>int ip_send(int IP_address, char * packet, int bytes)</tt> will send
the given number of bytes pointed to by "packet" to the specified IP address,
returning 0.  The call may fail (for example if the IP address is unreachable),
and then the return value will be -1.

<li><tt>int ip_receive(char * packet, int size, int * from, int
timeout)</tt> returns -1 if the call timed out (timeout is specified
in milliseconds).  If the call succeeded (did not time out) the packet
is filled with data (up to "size" -- any additional data in the packet
is discarded), the integer pointed to by "from" is filled with the
source IP address, and the number of bytes received is returned.

</ol>

Your project is to implement a small subset of TCP, but you must still
use the TCP header format.  The following fields of the TCP header MUST
be set appropriately:

<ul>

<li> source and destination ports -- remember to use big-endian byte order,
see also htons and ntohs

<li> sequence and acknowledgment numbers -- this means you must pick an
initial sequence number, and increment it when you send "SYN" or "FIN"
packets, as specified in the RFC.  Again, remember to send these in big-endian
order, perhaps using htonl and ntohl

<li> the ack, rst, syn, and fin flags

<li> the "data offset" field always has the value 5, since there are
no options and no padding.

<li> the checksum field -- see <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1071.txt">RFC 1071</a>.  You are
welcome to adapt the code from the RFC, but you should be aware that you
cannot use the code as given -- the C code in section 4.1 has bugs
that prevent correct computation of the checksum.  The checksum includes
the pseudo-header.

</ul>

I have made available the following files, on uhunix in directory
<tt>/home/1/esb/651/p2</tt>:

<ol>

<li><tt>ip.c</tt>, implementing a simulated IP (the simulator only
works with <tt>testtcp.c</tt>)

<li><tt>testtcp.c</tt>, a simple program that calls the TCP functions.

<li><tt>tcp.c</tt>, a skeleton for your implementation of
<tt>tcp.c</tt>.

<li><tt>ipsim.h</tt>, used by the C files.

<li><tt>makefile</tt>, a makefile for this program.

</ol>

The test program, specified in testtcp.c, will accept as command-line
arguments one of the following:

<ul>

<li> an IP number and four integers:
<ol>
<li> the simulated IP address
<li>a UDP port number for the simulator
<li>an initial timeout in milliseconds
<li>a TCP port number
<li>a delay in seconds.
</ol>
In this case, <tt>testtcp.c</tt> calls <tt>tcp_listen</tt> with the
specified initial timeout and TCP port number and, if successful,
waits the specified number of seconds before closing the connection
and exiting.

<p>For example, the following call: <tt> testtcp 1.2.3.4 5678 5000
9999 20 </tt>
<br> results in a call to
<tt>int c = tcp_listen (9999, ip_address_ptr, 5000)</tt>,
then if the call succeeds, waits 20
seconds before calling <tt>tcp_close (c)</tt>.

<li> an IP number and an integer (the simulated IP adddress and the
UDP port number for the local simulator), followed by sets of six
parameters:
<ol>
<li> the (real) IP number and
<li> the UDP port for the remote simulator that we should connect to
<li> the (simulated) IP address being implemented by the remote system
<li> a local and
<li> a remote TCP port number
<li> a duration (in seconds) that the connection should be kept open
</ol>
<tt>testtcp.c</tt> will accept up to ten sets, connect to each system in
turn (using <tt>tcp_connect</tt>), and close each connection after the
specified time.

<p>For example, the following call: <tt> testtcp 184.183.182.181 6789 128.171.44.7 5678 1.2.3.4
11111 9999 15</tt>
<br> results in a call to 
<tt>int c = tcp_connect (1.2.3.4, 11111, 9999)</tt>,
then if the call succeeds, waits 15
seconds before calling <tt>tcp_close (c)</tt>.  This connect example matches
and would connect to the listen example given in the previous line.

</ul>

<p>Note that some of the information given to <tt>testtcp.c</tt> is
stored in global variables used by <tt>ip.c</tt>, to transparently
perform the mapping between simulated IP addresses and underlying
UDP port numbers and addresses.


<h3>Details</h3>

<p> The call to <tt>tcp_connect</tt> should time out if more than 10
seconds expire without receiving a packet that was expected by the
state machine.

<p> Be sure your TCP works correctly when both sides call
<tt>tcp_connect</tt> (the "SYN-SENT, SYN-RCVD, ESTAB" path through the
state machine).

<p> This specification does not ever require you to retransmit a packet.

<p> This specification does not ever require you to transmit a packet
with any data.  Therefore, the "bytes" parameter to <tt>ip_send</tt>
should always have the value 20.  You should check the return value
of <tt>ip_receive</tt> to make sure the packets are 20 bytes long.

<p> See page 36 of the specification to find out when you need to send
a reset (cases 1 and 2 only).

<p> To correctly process an incoming reset, assume the window has size
1 byte.

<p> Both <tt>ip.c</tt> and <tt>testtcp.c</tt> can be compiled with the
"-DDEBUG" flag to enable print statements and to slow down message
generation.  See the source code for details.


<p>I do make mistakes.  If you find mistakes in the design of this
protocol, please send mail to <a href="mailto:esb@hawaii.edu">me</a>
or to the <a href="mailto:ics651-l@hawaii.edu">mailing list</a>.

<p>I am always happy to answer questions, but for this project, I
would encourage you to spend a little time looking for the answer to
your questions before you ask me.  All the source code is available --
try to understand testtcp.c and ip.c to the extent that they affect
your code.

<p>Make sure all your code and significant comments are in file tcp.c,
since that is the only file that will be turned in.
