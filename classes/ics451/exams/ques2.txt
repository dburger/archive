ICS 451 Fall 2001 Exam 2, October 26-October30.

This is a mail-in take-home exam.  It is due at 11:59pm on Tuesday,
October 30th, and must be mailed to esb@hawaii.edu in advance of that
deadline.  Please mail two identical copies at least 10-15 minutes
apart, and both of them before the deadline, since if I don't get a
submission on time, you will fail the exam.

The exam is open-book (any book), open notes, and calculators are
allowed.  You are not allowed to use the web (except for the course
web pages, including any web page referred to by the project, and the
web pages for the textbook, and your own personal web pages) nor to
consult with your friends or anybody else.  That means there is no
talking about the exam with ANYBODY, from the moment you read this
email until 12midnight on Tuesday.  If your answer includes any words
that you haven't written yourself, you must clearly mark the text as
such (give a complete reference, including title, author, and if
relevant also page number, edition, or URL).  If I detect any
violations of these rules, you may fail the exam.

All emails must be plain text only -- I will discard any email that
has attachments.  I will not answer any questions about the exam -- if
there is a question that you think is unclear, please read it more
carefully, considering all possible interpretations, and if it is
still unclear or ambiguous for you, please simply give your best
answer.  Please double-check and spell-check ("man spell" on uhunix2)
all your answers before turning in the exam.  All questions have the
same weight, 20% of the score.



======================================================================
Question 1.
The following IP packet (for which the header is shown) must be
divided into fragments to be sent over a network with an MTU of
576 bytes.  Show all the IP headers for all the fragments.  You do not
need to compute the IP header checksums.

45 00 04 B0
90 AB 03 21
18 11 -- --
80 AB 0A 01
80 AB 0A 02


======================================================================
Question 2.
List all the values of all the fields (including ethernet headers) of
all the packets sent in the following ARP exchange.  The Address
Resolution Protocol is invoked to find the hardware address of the
next hop for a packet with destination 1.2.3.4.  Assume the exchange
is over Ethernet, assume the sender's IP (on this Ethernet) is 2.3.4.5
and its ethernet address is 12:13:14:15:16:17, the next hop IP is
2.3.4.1, and the next hop ethernet address is 12:13:14:AB:CD:EF.


======================================================================
Question 3.
Given the IP network shown at
http://www2.ics.hawaii.edu/~esb/2001fall.ics451/ex21.gif, show the
routing table for router R5.  The table must contain an entry for each
interface of the router, and an entry for every network on the
Internet.  The columns of the routing table must be destination,
gateway, mask, interface, and cost (the cost of each link is 1, the
cost of various routes will of course vary).  Be sure to show multiple
routes where multiple, equal-cost routes exist.


======================================================================
Question 4.
When a packet is received by a learning bridge, the bridge assumes
that the sender of that packet can be reached through the interface on
which the packet was received.

Now assume an extension to the learning bridge algorithm.  In a
traditional bridged network there can be no loops.  The purpose of the
extension is to allow loops in the connections among bridges.  Using
this extension, a bridge keeps copies of all the packets it has
received in the last second.  If a packet received has the same exact
contents (including header) of a packet that the bridge has already
received, the bridge does not send this second copy or any subsequent
copies.

Does this scheme allow broadcasts to work correctly on networks that
have loops?  Briefly but clearly explain why or why not.  State any
assumptions you need to make.


======================================================================
Question 5.
ATM and IP both carry data end-to-end, and therefore work at the
network layer, but ATM is connection-oriented, whereas IP is
connectionless.  Compare and contrast the two, in your own words.
What are the advantages of a connectionless network layer, what are
the advantages of a connection-oriented network layer?  A full answer
will have a brief list of advantages/disadvantages, and a paragraph or
two of qualitative discussion about the differences.
