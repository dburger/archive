<h3>Overview</h3>
For my OS Experience I chose to work with the open source project Jetty.
Jetty is an open source HTTP servlet server written in Java.  I felt
that working with Jetty would give me an interesting perspective on
the work with <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a> that we will be doing later in this course.
Tomcat is, of course, the official Reference Implementation for Java
Servlet and Java Server Pages technologies sponsored by the Apache
Jakarta Project.  Because Jetty is much less known that Tomcat, I
felt it would be interesting to see what this project has to offer.<p />

The URL for Jetty can be found here:<p />

<a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/index.html">http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/index.html</a><p />

The objective of the team that produced Jetty is to make a 100% Java HTTP
servlet server.  The home page talks about the benefits of
having a single server that can act as both the HTTP server and servlet
container.  Apparently previous versions of Tomcat had to be deployed in
conjunction with Apache in order to provide static HTTP/1.1 content.
Another feature of Jetty that is touted on the home page is its size.
With a smaller deployment size than Tomcat, Jetty can be
embedded into other applications.  Integrating with Java applications is
particularly easy because Jetty is written in Java.
Jetty also claims to be highly efficient with the capability to handle
thousands of simultaneous connections.

<h3>Prime Directive 1</h3>
From looking at the applications that use Jetty as a web server it is very
apparent that Jetty is achieving prime directive number 1, that is it
successfully accomplishes a useful task.  That useful task being its
usage as an HTTP server, servlet container, and JSP server.
The list of applications that use Jetty is impressive, and includes
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss//">JBoss</a>
and <a href="http://www.jxta.org/">JXTA</a>.<p />

I was able to test out some of the useful technology myself by running
the demonstration programs that came with the Jetty distribution.  I
was able to fetch pages that demonstrated Jetty dumping headers,
dumping servlet parameters, and handling sessions.  In addition, the
examples that ship with Tomcat were also included.  All of the
examples ran without any problems.<p />

<h3>Prime Directive 2</h3>
The Jetty application is available for download in .zip and .tar.gz formats.
Being on sourceforge.net, there is also a CVS interface available if you want
to work with the latest code.  Installing the application was as simple as
downloading the compressed files and unpacking them on the target system.
In the main directory a README.TXT file gave very well written instructions on
getting Jetty running in a variety of specialized contexts.  Being a Java
application, this was as simple as launching start.jar with the java
interpreter.

The quick start section in the README.TXT file directed me to the
demonstration applications as noted above.  I decided
that for a test of usefulness I would write my own servlet
and see if I could quickly deploy it using the Jetty server.  The
servlet did nothing more than build a simple web page displaying the
current time. It took me some time to get the program deployed
properly as I have done little work with servlets before.  I found the
documentation at the Jetty site to be lacking in this area, however,
the Jetty platform conforms to the Servlet API specification so I was
able to get the needed documentation from the Tomcat web site.<p />

Because Jetty is often used as an embedded server a lot of
documentation was available that described using Jetty in such an
environment.  Although I did not experiment with Jetty in this
fashion, the code examples looked quite clear.<p />

The Jetty tutorial, available here:<p />

<a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/tut/index.html">http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/tut/index.html</a><p />

has a wealth of information for using Jetty as an embedded server.

<h3>Prime Directive 3</h3>
While the documentation for developers wishing to deploy applications using the
Jetty platform looked quite good, the documentation for developers wishing to
contribute to Jetty development seemed somewhat sparse.  I was unable to find
any documents that expressed the design of the system.  The closest thing to
developer documentation that I was able to find was a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=2638&group_id=7322&func=browse">task list</a>.  The task list
contains a list of the separate tasks that are currently being worked on, the
name of the person assigned to the task, and an estimate of how much work is
done on the task as a percentage.<p />

The code itself seemed to be well written.  It contained a consistent
formatting style with logically chosen variable names.  The Javadoc
standard was followed for most of the project giving developers a
handy way to learn about the design of the system.  The packages
seemed to be well organized.<p />

The build seems to be set up with the best open source tools available.  The
system is configured to use ant, and an extensive build.xml file is available
in the root directory of the distribution.  I located a section in the build
file called tests, and it had a comment that referred to running the test
harnesses.  The presence of these unit tests would certainly be an aid
to any programmer wishing to make a contribution.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Overall Jetty seems to be a pretty impressive project.  It has proven its
usefulness as a component of some high profile projects.  Jetty was also
very easy to install.  I was able to deploy my own simple servlet in only
a few minutes.  The documentation for a user of the Jetty system is quite
good when supplemented with information from the Tomcat site.  While
the developer documentation seemed to be somewhat lacking, the
presence of coding conventions, Javadoc, and unit testing would do a
lot to help developers that are new to the project.
