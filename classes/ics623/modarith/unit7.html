<H2>Unit 7--Doing Calculations</H2>
<p>Read the following section and do the calculation 1) at the end of it. Also, 
  write the programs and do the calculations requested in 2), 3), 4), and 5). 
  I would like to see your programs and calculated results for 2) through 5).</p>

<H3>Order of Multiplicative Groups mod n</H3>
<p>Theorem 7 on page 20 of the notes on algebra states that the group that you 
  get modulo n keeping only elements relatively prime to n is cyclic for the following 
  n: 1, 2, 4, p^k, and (2p)^k where p is an odd prime and k is any positive integer. 
  Furthermore, in the proof it is shown that if a is primitive mod p, then either 
  a or a+p is primitive mod p^2 and that same element is primitive mod p^k for 
  all k.</p>

<P>First, for completeness, I want to investigate the situation for even primes, 
  namely 2. I will show that mod 2^k, (k&gt;=3) the maximum order of any element 
  is 2^(k-2) (which is phi(2^k)/2), and 5 has that order. Note that since phi(2^k) 
  = 2^(k-1), the order of every element must be a power of 2. If a^m = 1 mod 2^k 
  a^m = 1+c*2^k for some c. Then a^(2*m)= (a^m)^2 = 1+2*c*2^k+2^(2*k)^2, and this 
  is equal to 1 mod 2^(k+1). Thus the order of an element mod 2^(k+1) is not more 
  than twice the order mod 2^k. Mod 8, all the elements except 1 (i. e. 3, 5, 
  and 7) have order 2, so the order mod 16 cannot exceed 4, the order mod 32 cannot 
  exceed 8, etc. In general, the order af an element cannot exceed 2^(k-2).</P>

<P>Now I will prove by induction that 5^(2^m)-1 is divisible by 2^(m+2)
but not by 2^(m+3). This is obviously true if m=0. Let us assume that it
is true for some value of m=a and try to show that it is true for m=a+1.
5^(2^(a+1))-1 = (5^(2^a))^2-1 = (5^(2^a)-1)*(5^(2^a)+1). With the assmuptions,
the first of those two factors is divisible by 2^(a+2) but not by 2^(a+3).
Therefore the other factor is divisible by 2, but not by 4 (because x-1
and x+1 cannot both be divisible by 4). Therefore the product is divisible
by 2^(a+3) but not by 2^(a+4). Therefore the order of 5 mod 2^k is 2^k-2),
because (taking m = k-2) 2^(k-2) = 1 mod 2^k, but (taking m=k-3) 2^(k-3)
is not equal to 1 mod 2^k.</P>

<P>The most common (but not very good) random number generators are variations
of this:</P>

<PRE>double random()
{
     static long rn = 17;
     static long A = 1220703125;
    
     rn = A*rn;
     return rn/4.294967296e9;
}</PRE>

<P>This gives you 17*A^n mod 2^32 for the nth value of rn. It is mod 2^32 because 
  the computer has 32-bit precision for integers and simply loses any multiple 
  of 2^32. Now you know the period of this random number generator. It is the 
  order of A--after that many steps, the value of rn will be 17. We would like 
  to maximize the order, so we could choose A=5, but that would result in numbers 
  that don't look very random. We should choose some larger number that has the 
  same order as A. Here I chose 5^13. There are many other choices, such as 2^16+5, 
  that give the same period. The order then is 2^30 which is about a billion.</P>
<P>The random number generator in many C implementations works mod 2^16, so their 
  period is only 2^14 = 16384.</P>

<P>Now, we can make use of the theorem to tell what orders are possible
mod n for any n, and we can even get some help in finding an element of
a specified order, if that order is possible. The notes explain how. Let
me do a few examples.</P>

<P>Let's do mod 5^20. phi(5^20) = 4*5^19, and the theorem states that this
group is cyclic, i. e. there is an element whose order is this value, and
all of its powers are all the elements of the group. In the proof of the
theorem, we find that if a is primitive mod 5, then either a or a+5 is primitive
mod 5^2, and that same element is primitive mod any power of 5. 2 has order
4 and therefore is primitive mod 5, and it is easy to check that 2 has order
20, and therefore is primitive, mod 25. (Actually, 2+5 is also primitive
modulo 25.) Then by the theorem we know that 2 is primitive mod any power
of 5.</P>

<P>2^31-1 = 2147483647 is a prime number. We know from the theorem that
the group mod 2^31-1 is cyclic, so we know that a primitive element exists.
In this case, I don't know any way to find a primitive element except by
trial and error. (There are some shortcuts in testing whether a chosen number
is primitive--the order of every element mod n divides phi(n). If an element
<I>a</I> is not primitive, its order divides phi(n) but is less than phi(n),
so you have to check only powers of <I>a</I> that divide phi(n), and if
none of these is 1, you know <I>a</I> must be primitive.)</P>

<P>With RSA we use the product of two large prime numbers. Let's consider
the product of two small prime numbers, say 127*149 = 18923. We know that
there is a primitive element a (of order 126) mod 127 and there is a primitive
element b (of order 148) mod 149. By the Chinese remainder theorem, there
is an element c mod 18923 such that c=a mod 127 and c=b mod 149. Then c^n=a^n
mod 127 and c^n=b^n mod 149. c^n = 1 mod 18923 if and only if c^n=1 mod
127 and c^n=1 mod 149, and therefore c^n=1 mod 18923 if and only if a^n=1
mod 127 and b^n=1 mod 149, and these will both be true only if n is a multiple
of both 126 and 148. The smallest n satisfying those conditions is the least
common multiple of 126 and 148 (LCM(126,148)) which is 126*148/GCD(126,148)
= 126*148/2 = 9324. That is the highest order possible. You can find an
element of this order by finding a and b by trial and error and solving
for c using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Actually, every element mod 18923
must have order that divides this number. Sometimes this number is called
psi(n).</P>

<P>A problem for you:</P>

<P>1) How many elements are there in the group of elements modulo 40000
that are relatively prime to 40000? What is the maximum possible order of
a number in this group? Calculate an element of this maximum order using
the Chinese remainder theorem and elements of maximum order modulo 2^6 and
5^4. (There are a lot of such elements.)</P>

<H3>Doing Arithmetic mod n in C</H3>

<P>There is a pretty good explanation in the printed notes. Let's try doing arithmetic 
  modulo p=2147483629, which is a 31-bit prime number.. Write functions to do 
  addition, subtraction, multiplication by 2 (which is the same as shift left 
  1 place), multiplication of any two numbers (less than p, of course), and raising 
  a number ot a power by fast exponentiation where the exponent is a 32-bit unsigned 
  integer, all modulo p, of course.</P>

<P>Let me try to explain how to write a program to multiply, relating it
to the formula that starts ab =. Look at the formula in the printed notes
as you read this. Now I want to write this as a loop. Since 2^31-1 has 31
binary digits (the leftmost of the 32 binary digits being zero), the loop
will be repeated 31 times, once for each binary digit in the multiplier.
If you study that formula you will find that you add a or nothing 31 times,
and you multiply by 2 only 30 times. To make my program simple, I multiplied
by 2 at the beginning one extra time to make things come out even. Then
it goes like this. I initialize the answer ab to zero. Then I multiply ab
by 2 (which does nothing this time). Then I check the leftmost binary digit
of the multiplier, and if it is 1, I add a to ab. Then I multiply ab by
2 again, and then check the second multiplier digit, and if it is 1, I add
a to ab. Then I multiply ab by 2 again, and then check whether the next
multiplier digit is 1, and if it is add a to ab. This is repeated until
the last multiplier digit is used, and then you have your answer.</P>

<P>Fast exponentiation is very similar to multiplication. Instead of adding,
you multiply, and instead of doubling, you square. In my program I do one
useless squaring to make the program as simple as possible. Initialize the
answer (let's call it r) to 1 this time, and then go through the loop 31
times. The first time, square r (using your multiply function), and check
the first exponent digit. If it is 1, multiply r by a. Then square r and
check the second exponent digit, and if it is 1, multiply r by a. Then square
r again and check the third expponent digit and multiply by a if it is not
zero. You repeat until you have used all 31 exponent binary digits. Then
you have the answer.</P>

<P>Both these programs are very simple. My version has a couple of initialization
statements and a while loop with 3 short lines of code inside, and the multiply
function and the exponentiation are the same size and look almost identical.</P>

<P>I think it is worth while for you to write programs to do these operations,
because then you will understand them better. I suggest that you test them
first with some very small numbers so that arithmetic is the same just plain
or mod p. Then you can go to some larger numbers. Try calculating this table:
(In general, hex is more convenient for large numbers.)</P>

<PRE>23^1 = 00000017<br>23^2 = 00000211<br>23^3 = 00002f87<br>23^4 = 00044521<br>23^5 = 006235f7<br>23^6 = 08d2d931<br>23^7 = 4af1837a<br>23^8 = 3bb2d0ed<br>23^9 = 5d10c609<br>23^10 = 5c81cbff<br>23^11 = 4fa95519<br>23^12 = 2836a649<br>23^13 = 1ce8f114<br>23^14 = 18eda92b<br>23^15 = 3d5a3329<br>23^16 = 031a9980<br>23^17 = 4763ca80<br>23^18 = 69f73264<br>23^19 = 05358865<br>23^20 = 77cf4113<br>23^21 = 439eda44<br>23^22 = 13459d00<br>23^23 = 3b411b39<br>23^24 = 52d972dd<br>23^25 = 718952e5<br>23^26 = 3356740f<br>23^27 = 1cc46e04<br>23^28 = 15a5e2bb<br>23^29 = 71e75f06<br></PRE>
<p>2) Do it first by multiplying each of these by 23 to get the next one.<br>
  Now try multiplying 23^15 and 23^14 and see whether you get 23^29. Then try 
  to do this table using your fast exponentiation function.</p>
<P>3) Pick a number from that table and raise it to the power p-1 = 2147483628. 
  What answer do you expect to get? (phi(p) = p-1) Now pick a number and raise 
  it to the power p-2 = 2147483627. Then multiply that result by the original 
  number. This is another way to get the inverse of a number.</P>

<h3>Doing GF(2^31) Arithmetic in C</h3>
<p>Now I want you to write similar programs and do similar calculations for GF(2^31). 
  Use the polynomial p(x) = x^31 + x^3 + 1. You should be able to make add and 
  subtract functions that are much simpler than the simple ones for mod p arithmetic, 
  and make slight changes in the function that multiplies by 2 mod p to make a 
  function that multiplies by x mod p(x). Then I found that I didn't have to change 
  the multiply or exponentiation functions. </p>
<p>Try doing calculations similar to 2) and 3). Let us let b = x^12 + x^2 + x 
  + 1. Then calculate the following table first by multiplying over and over by 
  b, and then by using the exponentiation function. Here are the results that 
  I got:</p>
<pre>b^1 = 00001007<br>b^2 = 01000015<br>b^3 = 0701514b<br>b^4 = 00120111<br>b^5 = 206f1765<br>b^6 = 107b1057<br>b^7 = 406413d2<br>b^8 = 00011349<br>b^9 = 1133e8ff<br>b^10 = 491479eb<br>b^11 = 38f39db8<br>b^12 = 13016fcf<br>b^13 = 6ffaee0d<br>b^14 = 21043836<br>b^15 = 249fedab<br>b^16 = 01051053<br>b^17 = 561e4099<br>b^18 = 46520f0f<br>b^19 = 734e93ac<br>b^20 = 31d34777<br>b^21 = 214f93a6<br>b^22 = 1fd4bf1a<br>b^23 = 14de816c<br>b^24 = 060f5047<br>b^25 = 6728c71c<br>b^26 = 39abfe8b<br>b^27 = 13bb7725<br>b^28 = 4d520434<br>b^29 = 42fd186d
</pre>
<p><br>
  4) Do this first by multiplying each of these by b to get the next one. Now 
  try multiplying b^15 and b^14 and see whether you get b^29. Then try to do this 
  table using your fast exponentiation function.</p>
<p>5) Pick a number from that table and raise it to the power 2^31-1 = 2147483648. 
  What answer do you expect to get? (Note that the set of all elements of GF(2^31) 
  except zero is a group and it has 2^31 - 1 elements.) Now pick a number and 
  raise it to the power p-2 = 2147483647. Then multiply that result by the original 
  number. This is another way to get the inverse of a number.</p>
<p>I would like to see your programs and the results of running them.</p>
