The goals of this project are:
<ol>
<li> to learn about the TCP protocol
<li> to implement reliable transmission
<li> to learn about sliding window transmission
</ol>

<p> This is an individual or group project, at your choice -- a group
may have a maximum of three people, and may not include any of the
people you worked with on project 2.  Send the instructor email if you
wish to join a group and would like the instructor to match you up
with others.  You may discuss concepts and ideas with other students,
but your group should be the sole author of all your code.  For the
program, you may choose any programming language that is available
on uhunix2.

<p> Submission is electronic and must be on time -- late submissions
will not be graded and will receive no credit.  So please submit what
you have on the due date, by 11:59pm HST on December 9th.  Please plan
to be done early if at all possible.

<p> The assignment is to write software to implement TCP
retransmission and windows.  These are described in the TCP RFC,
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0793.txt">RFC 793</a>.

<h2>TCP reliable transmission</h2>

A TCP implementation must 

<ul>

<li> Number every packet sent according to the sequence number of the
first byte it contains.

<li> Keep a timer, and when the timer expires, retransmit any
unacked packets.

<li> Receive incoming packets, process and ack any data they contain,
and remove acked packets from the retransmission buffer.

</ul>

For this project, you need not implement the full TCP state machine.
Your implementation will only have a single pre-established connection
with a pre-established initial sequence number.  Your implementation
will have to deal with delayed, duplicate, and lost packets.

<h2>Project Deliverables</h2>

I will expect the following from each group:

<ol>

<li> As soon as possible, an email from one representative of each
group specifying the names and emails of all the members of the group
(please Cc the other members of your group on the email).  This is
not required if you are working alone.

<li> For full credit, your code must also interoperate with the code
from another group.

<li> By the deadline, the source code (source and makefile only -- no
objects, binaries, or random files) for your implementation.  The
source code must compile and run on uhunix2.  Compilation must be
achieved by running ``make'' with no arguments (see
<tt>make(1S)</tt>).  If you use an interpreted language such as Java
which does not produce an executable binary, be sure to include a
shell script which calls your code.  You should also include a file
<tt>status</tt> that lists all the members of your group, describes
whether your program works and if not, what problems you are having.
The <tt>status</tt> file must also state whether your program
interoperated with that of another group, and if so, who the members
of that group are.

<li> Create a web page with links to each of your source files, make
file, and status file, and make it readable to the entire world.  You
do not need to try and make the web page look good -- any extensions
such as ".txt" will make it harder to download the data automatically
(if you wish, you may make another web page for your formatted
sources, and if you wish, you may publish that page).

<li> Send the URL for the web page with your solutions to the <a
href="mailto:esb@hawaii.edu">instructor</a>.  Your web page must
remain available for at least one week, giving the instructor and TAs
plenty of time to download it and review it.

<li> Please follow the naming instructions: name your makefile
<tt>makefile</tt> (all lower case), and your status file
<tt>status</tt> (no extension).  Your executable (or script) should be
<tt>mytcp</tt>.

</ol>

<h2>Program</h2>

<p>The program must implement the full TCP data transport protocol.
In particular, the program must both send and receive data.  The first
argument to your program, which must be called <tt>mytcp</tt>, is a
number giving the number of bytes to send.  If the number is negative,
that number of bytes should be sent only after the first segment has
been received from the other TCP.  The idea is that we run two such
programs to exchange data with each other, one with a positive number
of bytes, one with a negative number.  The number of bytes sent in the
two directions may be different.

<p>Each TCP starts with a window of 500 in both directions.  If the
first argument is negative, the initial sender sequence number is
12345678 (hex), if the first argument is positive, the initial sender
sequence number is FEDCBA98 (hex).  Whichever initial sender sequence
number is selected, the initial receiver sequence number is the other
number.

<p>The second, third, and fourth argument to <tt>mytcp</tt> are the
local UDP port number, the ip number or domain name of the machine on
which the peer is running, and the UDP port number to which you send
packets.  In this project, we are running a nonstandard TCP over UDP:
the segments are sent over UDP, all to the same destination, and we
expect to receive segments only from the specified destination.

<p> <tt>mytcp</tt> has an optional fifth argument (optional means you
are required to implement it, but it is not required to be on the
command line).  If that argument is present, it must be a number
<i>p</i> between 0 and 100.  If the argument is present, your TCP data
send routine must randomly discard <i>p</i> out of every 100 segments
sent.  In other words, <tt>mytcp</tt> must build and prepare to send
all the segments as usual.  Immediately before sending, there must be
a test to see if this packet should be randomly selected for discard,
and if the test returns true, the packet should not be sent.  If the
packet is to be sent, a separate test, with the same probability,
should immediately follow to see if the packet should be sent twice
(duplicate).

<p>Example command lines:

<ul>

<li> <tt>mytcp 100000000 5345 128.171.7.44 5867</tt>
<br>Send 100,000,000 bytes, initiating the send.  The local port is
5345, the remote port (on host 128.171.7.44) is 5867, and no
outgoing packets will be dropped.
<li> <tt>mytcp -100000 6345 maru.ics.hawaii.edu 5677</tt>
<br>The 
peer is running on maru.ics.hawaii.edu at port 5677.  My UDP port
is 6345, and once I receive the first packet, I should start sending
my 100,000 bytes.
</ul>

<p>The Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for your TCP is 53 bytes.  This size
does not include the TCP header, which in your case is always 20 bytes
long, so your TCP should send packets no larger than 73 bytes, and
should be prepared to receive packets of at most 73 bytes (including
headers).  The MSS is described in <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0879.txt">RFC 879</a> -- I especially
encourage you to review Section 5 of this RFC.

<p>Your TCP need not compute checksums.  The TCP checksum should be
sent as zero, and must be ignored on receipt.  If you have time and
desire at the end of this project, you may extend your program to
compute checksums, but this is not required (nor rewarded!), and the
program submitted should NOT discard received segments with a checksum
of 0.

<p>The port numbers are also ignored, and should be sent as all zeros.
The urgent pointer is likewise always zero.

<p>All your segments should have the ACK bit set, and carry a valid
ACK number.  All the other control bits must be zero, except for the
push bit which may have any value you like.

<p>The data you send should be legible to a human, i.e. consist only
of ASCII printable characters and newlines.  I encourage you to make
the lines no longer than 79 characters.  Data you receive should be
printed to stdout.  Your program should give the data to your TCP one
line at a time.  Your TCP should print the data only once you see an
end-of-line.  Be aware that the end-of-line character may be in the
middle of a segment, not at the end.

<p>You should ack the received segment before printing it to stdout,
but only slide the window to the right <b>after</b> the data is
printed to stdout.  The new window would be communicated in the next
ack that you send, which is either sent when the next segment is sent
or received, or after a 1 second timeout, whichever comes first.

<p> The design of the implementation of TCP is up to you.  You may use
threads, or select, or any other mechanism that works for you and the
programming language you select.  You have to spend some time (but not
too much time!) thinking about what the program needs to do and how
your program will implement that functionality.


</a><h2>Hints</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Binary Data</strong>

<p> All the data in the TCP header is binary.  Although the data in
the TCP payload should be ASCII, it will not be null-terminated, so in
most languages you will be unable to use string operations on it.

<li><strong>Printing Headers</strong>

<p>The program <tt>tcpdump</tt> has a standard and reasonably good way
of displaying TCP headers.  The following example is from the tcpdump
man page (slightly adapted -- the original is at <a
href="http://www.it.kth.se/edu/gru/Internet/tcpdump.html">
http://www.it.kth.se/edu/gru/Internet/tcpdump.html</a>).

<blockquote>

<p>Here is the opening portion of an rlogin from host rtsg to host csam.

<pre>
rtsg.1023 > csam.login: S 768512:768512(0) win 4096 
csam.login > rtsg.1023: S 947648:947648(0) ack 768513 win 4096 
rtsg.1023 > csam.login: . ack 1 win 4096
rtsg.1023 > csam.login: P 1:2(1) ack 1 win 4096
csam.login > rtsg.1023: . ack 2 win 4096
rtsg.1023 > csam.login: P 2:21(19) ack 1 win 4096
csam.login > rtsg.1023: P 1:2(1) ack 21 win 4077
csam.login > rtsg.1023: P 2:3(1) ack 21 win 4077 urg 1
csam.login > rtsg.1023: P 3:4(1) ack 21 win 4077 urg 1
<pre>

<p>The first line says that tcp port 1023 on rtsg sent a packet to port
<tt>login</tt> on csam. The S indicates that the SYN flag was set. The packet
sequence number was 768512 and it contained no data. (The notation is
`first:last(nbytes)' which means `sequence numbers first up to but not
including last which is nbytes bytes of user data'.)

<p>There was no piggy-backed ack, the available receive window was 4096
bytes and there was a max-segment-size option requesting an mss of
1024 bytes.

<p>Csam replies with a similar packet except it includes a piggy-backed
ack for rtsg's SYN. Rtsg then acks csam's SYN. The `.' means no flags
were set. The packet contained no data so there is no data sequence
number. Note that the ack sequence number is a small integer (1). The
first time tcpdump sees a tcp `conversation', it prints the sequence
number from the packet. On subsequent packets of the conversation, the
difference between the current packet's sequence number and this
initial sequence number is printed. This means that sequence numbers
after the first can be interpreted as relative byte positions in the
conversation's data stream (with the first data byte each direction
being `1'). `-S' will override this feature, causing the original
sequence numbers to be output.

<p>On the 6th line, rtsg sends csam 19 bytes of data (bytes 2 through 20
in the rtsg -> csam side of the conversation). The PUSH flag is set
in the packet.

<p>On the 7th line, csam says it has received data sent by rtsg up to but
not including byte 21. Most of this data is apparently sitting in the
socket buffer since csam's receive window has gotten 19 bytes
smaller. Csam also sends one byte of data to rtsg in this packet.

<p>On the 8th and 9th lines, csam sends two bytes of urgent, pushed data
to rtsg.

</blockquote>

If you implement this for your own program, you would of course have
little use for port numbers or flags, but the sequence, ack, and
window information would be useful.

<p>

<li><strong>Prioritizing</strong>

<p> For this project as for the last, you should try and get a
prototype working as soon as possible, and then proceed to add the
refinements required for this project.

<p> The most important functionality is sending and receiving the
data, and sending and processing acks.  You must then add
retransmission timers, a data structure to save the data that might
have to be retransmitted, window processing, dropping and duplicating
a percentage of the packets, and interoperation with others' projects.
You do need these components for full credit, but you can get some
partial credit even if you only have the basic functionality.

<li><strong>Interoperation</strong>

<p> You may post to the course mailing list to find others who are
ready to test for interoperation.  I strongly encourage you to do this
<b> only after </b> you are convinced that your program works,
reliably sending data in the presence of errors when tested against
itself.
