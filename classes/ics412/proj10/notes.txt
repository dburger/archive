A shell script is included that will allow you to:

./fifoctl up 10

or

./fifoctl down 10

Note that testing this program can be done without doing file operations in
a program.  This can be done by writing out to the fifo using:

cat > /dev/fifo0

or

cat something.txt > /dev/fifo0

and reading in via:

more /dev/fifo1

Some of the tests that should be run against this program are that a reader
will return with EOF if no writer has a fifo open and no data is currently
in the fifo.  Also, you should be able to open multiple writers on a fifo,
and the reader should continue to run until the last one is shut down.

Because of the way that file_operations has been assigned to filp in the
open, based upon minor number, even minor numbers only get a write function
and odd minor numbers only get a read function.  Therefore appropriate error
messages are thrown when attempting to read the writer or write the reader!

Just posted this up and realized the filp->f_mode can be used to determine
FMODE_READ and FMODE_WRITE during the open call.  Maybe an error should be
thrown on open if they attempt FMODE_READ on an even fifo or FMODE_WRITE on an
odd one.  Right now they will get the error when they attempt to do the
disallowed read or write.
