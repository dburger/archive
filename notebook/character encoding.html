<div class="PubNoteContentArea">This information was proved wrong...setting the charset attribute of the returned script element seemed to make all browsers digest it just fine.<br><br>It appears it is not possible to get all browsers to accept a mixed
character encoding.  What I&#39;m talking about is when the page has one
encoding and then either an On Demand Javascript (ODJ) or framed fetch
returns a different encoding.  Within the ageo system this comes into
play when the page hosting our mashup is in iso-8859-1 and we attempt
to return either of the aforementioned contents as utf-8.  Firefox has
no problems with this type of mixed encoding.  Safari and Internet
Explorer both have problems when doing this type of encoding and don&#39;t
render the content correctly.<br>
<br>
For ODJ calls there are certain ways you can try to work around the problem.  Many of these have been investigated here:<br>
<br>
<div>
  <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/%7Edburger/broken.html">http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dburger/broken.html</a><br>
</div>
<br>
Adding the charset attribute to the script element appeared to hold
promise but did not work on the mac would used in an ODJ manner.  Thus
no cross browser way of getting mixed encodings to work with ODJ was
found.  Maybe in the next release of Safari the charset parameter will
do the trick.<br>
<br>
For framed included pages I have not done such experimentation but the
same problem exists.  That is if the frame returns in a different
encoding that the enclosing page Safari will not render it correct. 
Firefox is fine with this and I have not witnessed the result on
Internet Explorer.<br>
<br>
So the solution we have in place now involves multiple ways to
determine the encoding of the mashup, with this information being sent
back to the ageo server on each request.  The encoding in the mashup is
set in a variable called ageo.request, and can be set in three ways
from highest to lowest priority:<br><br><ol><li>by passing in the encoding= parameter on the initial ageo script request.</li><li>by setting an encoding license property in the database</li><li>by javascript sniffing the encoding in the client, for now only looking for meta tag</li></ol><br>If the encoding technique is not determined from any of these means, the ageo.encoding variable is left undefined.<br><br>So
on every ODJ request the ageo controller makes sure to tack on
encoding=&quot;the encoding&quot; if this value is defined.  Then, as the ODJ
call goes through JsonResponseUtilities setHeaders method it looks on
this value, if it is set it attempts to use it.  If it is not set then
it defaults to utf-8.  This works something like this:<br><br><div>response.setContentType(&quot;application/x-javascript; charset=&quot; + encoding);<br></div><br>Of
course if there are links or forms that fetch other content into the
mashup then an ODJ call is not involved and thus the encoding cannot be
transmitted in the same manner.  Furthermore when the result that comes
back is actually a .jsp page then the encoding can&#39;t be set in the same
manner.<br><br>To get the links to have this parameter javascript client code will be needed looking something like this:<br><br><div>&lt;a
href=&quot;yadayada?&lt;script&gt;if (ageo.encoding != undefined)
document.write(&quot;encoding=&quot; +
ageo.encoding)&lt;/script&gt;&quot;&gt;whatever&lt;/a&gt;<br></div><br>For forms the code can be similar but a bit cleaner:<br><br><div>&lt;form ....&gt;<br>    form elements<br>    &lt;script&gt;<br>        if (ageo.encoding != undefined) {<br>            document.write(&#39;&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;encoding&quot; value=&quot;&#39; + ageo.encoding + &#39;&quot;/&gt;&#39;);<br>        }<br>    &lt;/script&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br></div><br>With
these in place, the only question left to answer is how to write this
out in a .jsp file.  To put the charset out statically in a jsp page
you use a page directive like this:<br><br><div>
&lt;%@ page contentType=&quot;text/html; charset=Big5&quot; %&gt;<br></div><br>Of
course we can&#39;t do that, we must do it dynamically based upon the value
of the encoding parameter.  Now this step may be server dependent,
because you have to set the encoding before the output writer has been
fetched.  I believe on Tomcat, this will be ok by doing this very near
the top of the jsp before any outputs have been created:<br><br><div>&lt;%<br>    String encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;;<br>    String requestedEncoding = request.getParameter(&quot;encoding&quot;);<br>    if (requestedEncoding != null) {<br>        // Andy&#39;s trick for making sure it is a valid encoding for this server<br>        try {<br>            Charset cset = Charset.forName(requestedEncoding);<br>            encoding = cset.name();<br>        } catch (Exception exc) {<br>            // maybe a log message<br>        }<br>    }<br>    response.setContentType(&quot;text/html; charset=&quot; + encoding);<br>%&gt;<br></div><br>If
this can be rolled out as a tag that would be the way to go.  Yes, all
this work just because Safari, and IE to a lesser extent, won&#39;t accept
mixed encodings.</div>

<div class="PubNote">
<div class="PubNoteContentArea">GET uses URLs.  URLs encode non-ASCII characters in UTF-8.  RFC 3986
and 3987 are clear on this point.  Thus in our server.xml for the
connector we have:<br><br><div>useBodyEncodingForURI=&quot;false&quot; URIEncoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;<br></div><br>This
will cause GET requests to be correctly decoded from UTF-8.  For POST
things are a bit different.  What we are doing now is along the lines
of this with the RequestEncodingValve.java:<br><br><div>if (request.getCharacterEncoding() == null) request.setCharacterEncoding(&quot;UTF-8&quot;);<br></div><br>This
needs to be done because if the request.getCharacterEncoding() is null
Tomcat will attempt to decode as the platform default, which in our
case is ISO-8859-1.  This appears to work so far, but I&#39;m concerned
with broken clients who will not set the character encoding on the
request and will encode in the page encoding.  So say the page is
iso-8859-1 and the form submits in that encoding, but the browser does
not add any information about that to the request headers.  This will
cause us to try and interpret as utf-8.  With forms you can set the
enctype attribute.  The default is
&quot;applicatino/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;.  It would seem from the
&quot;urlencoded&quot; that this means we are going to get utf-8 but time will
tell.<br><span></span><span><a href=""><span></span></a></span></div>
