The goals of this project are:
<ol>
<li> to implement a learning ethernet bridge
<li> to learn about the ethernet protocol
<li> to practice using threads and queues
</ol>

<p> This is a group project.  A group may have 1, 2, 3, or 4 people.
Send the instructor email if you wish to join a group and would like
the instructor to match you up with others.  You may discuss concepts
and ideas with other students, but your group should be the sole
author of all your code.  All your code must be written in C.

<p> Submission is electronic and must be on time -- late submissions
will not be graded and will receive no credit.  So please submit what
you have on the due date, by 11:59pm HST on October 26th.  Please plan
to be done early if at all possible.

<p> The assignment is to write software for an Ethernet Learning
Bridge.  The software receives Ethernet packets over one of several
possible interfaces, and transmits them as appropriate.  Your software
must simulate the underlying hardware as well as implement the
bridging function.

<h2>Ethernet Bridging</h2>

Ethernet Bridging was discussed in the lecture, and is presented in
chapter 10 (second edition) or 11 (third edition) of the textbook.  A
learning bridge must:

<ul>

<li> Forward broadcast packets to all other interfaces

<li> Forward a packet for an unknown destination address A to all other interfaces

<li> Forward a packet for a known destination address A to the interface on
which A is connected

<li> Record as known any source address of a packet received on any interface

<li> Time out "known" addresses after 1 minute of inactivity

</ul>

<h2>Project Deliverables</h2>

I will expect the following from each group:

<ol>

<li> As soon as possible, an email from one representative of each
group specifying the names and emails of all the members of the group
(please Cc the other members of your group on the email).

<li> By the deadline, the source code (source and makefile only -- no
objects, binaries, or random files) for your implementation.  The
source code must compile and run on uhunix2.  Compilation must be
achieved by running ``make'' with no arguments (see
<tt>make(1S)</tt>).  You should also include a file <tt>status</tt>
that describes whether your program works and if not, what problems
you are having.

<li> Create a web page with links to each of your source files,
make file, and status file, and make it readable to the entire
world.  You do not need to publish the web page.  You do not need
to try and make the web page look good -- any extensions such
as ".txt" will make it harder to download the data automatically
(if you wish, you may make another web page for your formatted
sources).

<li> Send the URL for that web page to the <a
href="mailto:esb@hawaii.edu">instructor</a>.  Your web page must
remain available for at least one week, giving the instructor, TAs,
and your colleagues plenty of time to download it and review it.  If
we are unable to download your page automatically on the deadline, you
will get no credit for the project.

<li> Please follow the naming instructions: name your makefile
<tt>makefile</tt> (all lower case), and your status file
<tt>status</tt> (no extension).

<li> Please turn in your project by the deadline.  After the deadline
you will be asked to review others' projects, and therefore you can
get no credit for any work turned in after the deadline.

</ol>

All code must be your own, except for what you take from
<tt>testbridge</tt>, below.

<h2>Program</h2>

<p>I want you to write a learning ethernet bridge (the executable
should be called <tt>bridge</tt>).  The bridge reads its configuration
from the command line, and immediately starts forwarding any packets
it receives.

<p>The command line has one argument for each simulated interface.
The argument identifies the local UDP port used for communicating on
that interface, and the remote system that the bridge is connected to
in our simulation.  The remote system can be another bridge or a
simulated end-system.  An interface is described by an IP number (of
the form 12.34.56.79) and a UDP port number (a decimal number between
1025 and 65535).  As command-line arguments, interfaces are given as
<tt>1234:12.34.56.79:2345</tt>, with the first number being the UDP
port number of this interface for this bridge, the second number the
IP number of the peer, and the third number the UDP port on which the
peer is listening for this simulated connection.  The maximum number
of connections your bridge must be able to simulate is 20.

<p>An example command-line invocation would be

<pre>
bridge 8956:1.2.3.4:24356 8957:128.171.44.7:5577
</pre>

This bridge has two simulated interfaces, the first listening on port
8956 and the second on port 8957.  The first one will send packets to
another simulated ethernet system (another simulated bridge, or a
simulated end-system) running on port 24356 of machine 1.2.3.4.  The
second interface will send packets to another simulated ethernet
system running on port 5577 of uhunix2.

<p>Your software must open a UDP socket for each simulated interface,
and be always prepared to receive packets coming in on these
interfaces (it doesn't matter which machine/port they are coming from,
you should receive them and process them).  Please be aware that if
your software is not receiving on an interface at all times, UDP
packets may be lost.  Consequently, you must structure your program as
a collection of POSIX threads (pthreads -- see
<tt>pthreads(3THR)</tt>), at least one receive thread per
interface.

<p> Once a packet is received, your software must decide which
interface, or interfaces, to send it on (the packet is always sent
unchanged).  Since there is limited bandwidth on each simulated
interface, you must make sure you do not send more than one packet per
second.  This generally is best done by having a send thread for each
interface (in addition to the receive thread for that interface), and
having the send thread wake up every second, check its queue, and send the
first packet in the queue if there is one there.

<p> This means you must implement a queue of packets for each
interface.  Packets should be stored in buffers created using
<tt>malloc(3C)</tt>.  Pointers to packets should be stored in your
queues.  Queues should have a maximum length of 10 packets.  When
inserting a packet into a queue, only insert it if there is room.  If
there is no room, do not insert the packet -- instead, continue
processing (i.e. insert it into any other queues that it must be
placed on).  Once a packet is sent, it should be removed from the
queue and its memory deallocated using <tt>free(3C)</tt>.  Note that
if the same buffer is placed on more than one queue, you can only call
<tt>free(3C)</tt> once, the last time you send the packet.  Packets
each have a maximum length of 1514 bytes (including the Ethernet
header), so buffers should all be allocated to be of that size.

<p> Note that since multiple threads may be trying to insert a
packet into a queue at the same time, and at the same time
that the sender thread for that queue is may be trying to remove
the first packet in the queue, you should synchronize access to
each queue.  I suggest you look at <tt>pthread_mutex_init(3THR)</tt>
for ways to synchronize access to your queues.

<p> Each packet you receive has a standard 14-byte Ethernet header,
beginning with a 6-byte destination address, 6-byte source address,
and 2-byte ethernet type.  Your program will only be concerned
with the destination and source addresses.  When you receive a
packet, its length (as given by <tt>recvfrom(2)</tt>) may be
less than the size of the buffer.  You should keep track of this
length and only send that many bytes when you forward the packet.
You should discard any packets received that are less than 60 bytes
long.

<p> Your program also need a central forwarding table that keeps track
of which interface has seen packets from which source address, and
also the most recent time a packet has been seen on that interface
from that address.  One additional thread should wake up every second
and remove entries more than 60 seconds old.  All accesses that modify
this central table must be synchronized to prevent concurrent accesses
from making the table inconsistent.

<p> The Ethernet broadcast address is the all-ones address, conventionally
written as ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (or alternately FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).

<p> In summary, <tt>bridge</tt> should forward packets according to
the algorithms for a learning bridge.

</a><h2>Test Program</h2>

I am providing a test program, <tt>testbridge</tt>.  This program
simulates an ethernet host, and takes as arguments:

<ol>

<li> a UDP port number that this program should listen on

<li> a simulated ethernet number that this program uses as its source address

<li> zero or more arguments indicating the packets to be sent, one
at a time, one second apart.  Each of these arguments has a simulated
ethernet number, followed by the IP address of the peer, and the UDP
port number of the peer.  The form of these arguments is
<tt>12:34:56:78:9A:BC/1.2.3.4:5678</tt>, with the first six
(hexadecimal) numbers giving the Ethernet address, the next four
(decimal) the IP address, and the final number the UDP port number.

</ol>

An example invocation would be
<pre>
testbridge 5786 11:66:22:55:33:44 11:01:02:03:04:05/128.171.44.7:7856 11:66:22:55:33:05/128.171.44.7:7856 12:67:23:56:34:46/128.171.44.7:7856 
</pre>

This invocation calls <tt>testbridge</tt> and tells it to send three
packets, all to port 7856 of <tt>uhunix2</tt>.  The first two packets
should have 11:01:02:03:04:05 as the destination Ethernet address, and
the third should have 12:67:23:56:34:46.  All three packets would have
11:66:22:55:33:44 as the source Ethernet address.  <tt>testbridge</tt>
will also keep running and print any packets it receives.

<p><tt>testbridge</tt> listens for incoming packets while it sends its
own packets, and keeps listening after it is done sending -- you must
kill it with ^C (Control-C) when you are done using it.

<p>You are welcome to write your own test program(s) if there is some
aspect of your program that <tt>testbridge</tt> doesn't address.  You
are also requested to forward to the instructor any bug reports about
testbridge.  The binary for testbridge is available at
<tt>~esb/testbridge</tt>.  The source code for testbridge is shown at
the end of this web page.  You may reuse any code you wish, but note
that your code <strong>must</strong> use pthreads, whereas
<tt>testbridge</tt> uses <tt>select</tt>.

</a><h2>Hints</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Binary Data</strong>

<p>
All the data in this project are binary.  There are no strings.  If
you ever find yourself using a string operation such as
<tt>strlen(3C)</tt>, think again.  The only exception is when parsing
the command-line arguments to <tt>bridge</tt>.

<p> This means that you have to explicitly keep track of the length of
each buffer, by keeping an integer variable or field that has the
number of bytes in the buffer.

<p> This also means you will need a way to visualize your data.  I
strongly suggest you start by creating a function that will print
the bytes in a buffer, one at a time, in hexadecimal.  For example,
a buffer with five bytes might print as:

<pre>
  xFE xDC xBA x98 x76
</pre>

Then you can use this function while debugging your code, for example
to print out incoming packets, ethernet addresses, or even the contents
of queues.

<li><strong>Linking</strong>

<p> Be sure to link with <tt>-lpthread</tt>.

<li><strong>Prioritizing</strong>

<p> It seems to me that some of you run out of time, with nothing to show
for all your hard work.  You should try and get a prototype working as
soon as possible, and then proceed to add the refinements required for
this project.

<p> The most important functionality is the packet forwarding,
followed by a correct implementation of the forwarding table.

<p> The least essential part of the project are the queues -- you
should first implement queues of size 1 (i.e. no queues, the sender is
either busy or idle), with no synchronization, then enlarge the queues
to 10 packets and then add synchronization.  You may also want to
start with fixed, global buffers, and only later move to using
<tt>malloc</tt>.  There are many other ways to split up the project to
make sure you have at least a basic ethernet bridge working by the
deadline.



<li><strong>Testing</strong>

<p>I suggest you start testing with one bridge at a time, making
sure the threads are working correctly and the forwarding mechanism
is correct.  Copious output from your program may help testing.

<p> After one bridge is working correctly, both for the first packet
from a source, for subsequent packets from a source, and for broadcast
packets, I suggest you connect multiple bridges to each other and
verify that the behavior is correct.  If your bridges are connected in
a loop, broadcast packets should live forever. If you have two or more
loops, broadcast packets should increase forever (and you should get
lots of queue overflows).  If you have no loops, broadcast packets and
the first packet from a new sender should go everywhere, and every
other packet should only be seen on the route to the destination.

<p><li> <strong>Strings</strong>.

<p> Data read from the network is not in C string format and is
encoded in binary.

<p><li> <strong>Read or Recv or Recvfrom</strong>.

<p> Since we are using UDP and not TCP, remember that your program
will get all of a packet data in a single read.

<p><li> <strong>Debugging</strong>.

<p>If you haven't done so already, you may want to learn to use the
<tt>gdb</tt> debugger, or any other debugger available on your system.
If you use <tt>gdb</tt>, you may want to check the <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html">
GDB Manual</a>.
