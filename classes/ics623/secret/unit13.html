<H2>Unit 13--Secret Sharing &amp; Time Stamping</H2>

<P>Read the material on &quot;secret splitting&quot;, pages 70-71, and the material 
  on &quot;secret sharing&quot; on pages 71-73 and 528-531. I am primarily interested 
  in the basic algorithms for secret sharing, and what Schneier calls the &quot;Lagrange 
  Interpolating Polynomial Scheme&quot; for secret sharing. I will give each student 
  one point on a polynomial P(X) of degree 3. You will have to get three more 
  points by trading with your classmates. Then when you have the four points, 
  you can calculate the secret P(0). This can be done in any finite field. Just 
  for variety, let's use GF(2^255) using the primitive degree 255 polynomial that 
  is in Schneier's book. That will limit us to a 255-bit secret. I will choose 
  a suitable secret. Everybody will have the same secret, of course. That little 
  French saying that I gave you once indicates that it may not be secret too long. 
  Please let me see your program, too. I will give you your share of the secret 
  when you complete Unit 14, or earlier if you request it.</P>

<H3>Secret Splitting</H3>

<P>Suppose you want to give some information to a group of m people in such
a way that they cannot see the information until they are all together.
This might be the combination to a safe, and you want them to be able to
open it only if they are all present. How can you do it? This is what Schneier
calls &quot;secret splitting&quot;, and he describes a very simple way to
do it on pages 70-71. You generate m-1 random numbers with at least as many
bits as the secret, and then give one of these numbers to each of the participants
except one. The last person receives the exclusive-or sum of the secret
and the m-1 random numbers. When all the persons are together, they can
calculate the sum of all the m numbers that they have. The sum will be the
secret. This scheme, unlike most of the ciphers we have studied, is theoretically
completely safe. If one person is absent, then the others have no information
about what the secret is. There is no way to do something like an exhaustive
search and find the missing person's number or the secret. The last person's
number could make the result be anything whatsoever.</P>

<H3>Secret Sharing</H3>

<P>Now suppose you have n people and you want to give them a secret such
that any m of them together can recover the secret. For example, you give
some information about the combination to the safe to all the members of
the board of directors, and now they can recover the information and open
the safe if at least four of them are present. Schneier presents this and
a variety of similar problems on pages 71-73. He presents several algorithms
for dealing with this situation in Section 23.2 on page 528. In my opinion,
by far the best of these is what he calls the &quot;LaGrange Interpolating
Polynomial Scheme&quot;. The idea behind this scheme is that if you have
a polynomial P(X) of degree m and you know m+1 points on it, you can calculate
all the coefficients in the polynomial and thus you know the polynomial.
The usual way to put in the secret is to make it the constant term in the
polynomial. Thus, P(0) is equal to the secret. You give one point to each
member of the board, and if m+1 of them get together, they can figure out
what the polynomial is, calculate P(0), and then they have the combination
and can open the safe.</P>

<P>Now I will assume a polynomial of degree 3. This generalizes in the obvious
way, but I think it will be easier to write and easier to read if I take
a specific case. Then P(X) = A*X^3 + B*X^2 + C*X + D. I will set D equal
to the secret and choose random numbers for A and B and C. Now I can give
points to at most as many people as there are points in the field, and usually
that will be a very large number. I don't see any reason not to give the
values (1, F(1)), (2, F(2)), (3, F(3)), . . . etc. In fact I will do that.
I will give a different point to each person in the class. Then you are
going to have to trade points with any three other persons in the class
so that you have four points. Then in theory, you can calculate A, B, C,
and D. Actually, you don't want A, B, and C. If you can figure out how to
get D, you have what you want.</P>

<P>Schneier suggests writing the four equations you can get when you have
four points (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), (X3, Y3), and (X4, Y4). I guess I will write
those equations:</P>

<P>A*X1^3 + B*X1^2 + C*X1 + D = Y1</P>

<P>A*X2^3 + B*X2^2 + C*X2 + D = Y2</P>

<P>A*X3^3 + B*X3^2 + C*X3 + D = Y3</P>

<P>A*X4^3 + B*X4^2 + C*X4 + D = Y4</P>

<P>In these equations, the unknows are A, B, C, and D. The determinant on
the left side has a special form. It is known as a VanDerMonde determinant,
and its value is zero if and only if two of the X's are equal, so it is
guaranteed that you can solve the equation if you have four different points.</P>

<P>Strangely, what Schneier didn't mention is how LaGrange got into the
act. Lagrange found a formula for P(X) in terms of the four points (X1,
Y1), (X2, Y2), (X3, Y3), and (X4, Y4). I will write that formula here. I
believe that this is the easiest way to find P(X). I don't know about speed.
I guess that it is about as fast as solving those equations directly. So
I recommend using this method after you get your four points. The formula
is as follows:</P>

<PRE>P(X) = Y1*(X - X2)*(X - X3)*(X-X4)/((X1 - X2)*(X1 - X3)*(X1-X4)) +
       Y2*(X - X1)*(X - X3)*(X-X4)/((X2 - X1)*(X2 - X3)*(X2-X4)) +
       Y3*(X - X1)*(X - X2)*(X-X4)/((X3 - X1)*(X3 - X2)*(X3-X4)) +
       Y4*(X - X1)*(X - X2)*(X-X3)/((X4 - X1)*(X4 - X2)*(X4-X3))</PRE>

<P>For the first line, the value will be zero if X = X2 or X = X3 or X =
X4, but it will be Y1 if X = X1. For the second line, the value will be
zero if X = X1 or X = X3 or X = X4, but it will be Y2 if X = X2. For the
third line, the value will be zero if X = X1 or X = X2 or X = X4, but it
will be Y3 if X = X3. For the fourth line, the value will be zero if X =
X1 or X = X2 or X = X3, but it will be Y4 if X = X4. Thus the sum will be
P(X) = Y1 if X = X1, P(X) = Y2 if X = X2, P(X) = Y3 if X = X3, and P(X)
= Y4 if X = X4. Thus the P(X) in this formula goes through the four specified
points. Clearly it is a polynomial of degree 3. It must be the right polynomial.</P>

<P>Now when you calculate this, all you want to know is D = P(0), so you
may substitute 0 for X in the above formula and calculate. I used divide
signs in the formulas. You don't really divide. Calculate A/B by multiplying
A and the inverse of B. Of course, since we are usnig a field of characteristic
2 (i. e. based on GF(2)), - and + are the same.</P>

<P>This system, like the &quot;secret splitting&quot; algorithm, is perfectly 
  safe--if you have only three points on the polynomial, you have no information 
  about D. D could be anything, depending on the fourth point. To see how that 
  is so, note that given three points (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), and (X3, Y3), and any 
  D you choose, say D1, then I can find a polynomial P1(X) that goes through the 
  four points (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), (X3, Y3), and (0, D1). Then I can choose any 
  other point (X4, Y4) where Y4 = P1(X4), and then the polynomial that I get using 
  the four points (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), (X3, Y3), and (X4, Y4) will be P1(X), and 
  P1(0) will be D1. Therefore, if you have fewer than 4 points, the value of D 
  could be anything at all.
