Project #1

This is my project number one submission.  It is a simple cross referencer
for Emacs Lisp code.  Please note that I have added an enhancement to the
code that was not required, but makes the program a little nicer.  Specifically
I have added code that automatically figures out what functions will result
from the macro expansion of defstruct, and adds these functions to a list of
functions available via macro expansion while making sure that these functions
haven't already found their way into the hash table.  You can find more
details in the included code.

There is commented out unit testing code at the bottom of the file.

Please note that if you are grading this on a Windows box my program was
developed totally on a Linux box...so if you have trouble with line endings
or something let me know.  For example I noticed that my Linux distribution
of Emacs doesn't need the (require 'cl) line but the distributions on
Windows seem to need it.  So if you see any strange problems like this let me
know so that I can correct.
