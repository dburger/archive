This is a guide to the changes that were necessary to convert the linux ipc
system from using its dynamic array implementation to using a linked list.
Notice that all changes are marked with "dburger" in the code, and things
removed have merely been commented out.  The mentioned files can be found on
this web site, and a tester program called shmtest.c is also present.  This
program can effectively test if shm and sem are working well with the list
implemenation.  For a real kicker run four or more than one copy of the program
at the same time.

1.  Added:
    
    struct list_head list;
    int lid;

    to the struct kern_ipc_perm in /usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/ipc.h.

util.h = /usr/src/linux-2.4/ipc/util.h

2.  Removed the entire struct ipc_id in util.h.

3.  Removed struct ipc_id *entries in the struct ipc_ids in util.h.

4.  Added struct list_head entries to the struct ipc_ids in util.h.

5.  Removed bounds check and array reference in ipc_get in util.h.

6.  Added a block that uses lists in ipc_get in util.h.  Changed return below
    the block to return NULL; instead of return out;.

7.  Removed bounds check and array reference in ipc_lock in util.h.  Also
    moved spin_lock before this commented out block.

8.  Added a block that uses lists in ipc_lock in util.h.  Removed the NULL test
    below the block and changed to unlocking and then returning NULL.

util.c = /usr/src/linux-2.4/ipc/util.c

9.  Removed alloc of entries in ipc_init_ids in util.c.

10. Added INIT_LIST_HEAD to ipc_init_ids in util.c and removed the NULL check
    directly below.

11. Removed the initialization of array to NULL loop in ipc_init_ids in util.c.

12. Removed int id and array iteration loop in ipc_find_key in util.c.

13. Changed the struct kern_ipc_perm *p to *perm in ipc_find_key in util.c.

14. Added list iteration block to ipc_findkey in util.c.  Changed ipc_findkey
    to return the lid added above and not an array index.

15. Removed the entire grow_ary function in util.c.

16. Removed resizing and array iteration block in ipc_addid in util.c.  Also
    removed return -1;.

17. Added ids->size++ to ipc_addid in util.c.

18. Removed ids->entries[id].p = new in ipc_addid in util.c.

19. Added a block that does an in order add of the new id looking for the first
    gap.  Moved the max_id check and assignment to the bottom of this block.

20. Removed bounds check, array reference, and NULL out in ipc_rmid in util.c.

21. Added list iteration and list member removal block in ipc_rmid in util.c.

22. Changed struct kern_ipc_perm *p to *perm in ipc_rmid in util.c.

23. Added ids->size--; to ipc_rmid in util.c.

24. Removed max_id adjustment in ipc_rmid in util.c.

25. Added new max_id adjustment block to ipc_rmid in util.c.

26. Added #include <linux/list.h> to util.c.
