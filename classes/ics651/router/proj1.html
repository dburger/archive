The goals of this project are:
<ol>
<li> to learn about IP
<li> to implement a simple IP router
<li> to practice using the sockets interface
<li> to learn about realistic network simulation
<li> to practice using C and threads
</ol>

<p>This is an individual project.  You may discuss concepts and ideas
with other students, but you should be the sole author of all your
code.  Limited debugging help is allowed, as long as it doesn't involve
looking at each other's code.  I will ask you to look at each other's
code after this project is complete.

<p>The project is due Tuesday, February 12th 2002, any time.
Submission is electronic.  Please send in your project on time -- late
submissions will not be accepted, and I prefer to have
partially-working projects rather than no project at all.

<p>To submit the project, please follow these steps:

<ol>

<li> create two directories, <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> on <tt>uhunix2</tt>

<li> copy all your sources (all your <tt>.c</tt> and <tt>.h</tt>
files, and your <tt>makefile</tt>), and only your sources, to both
<tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>

<li> <tt>cd</tt> to directory <tt>x</tt>

<li> type <tt>make</tt> with no arguments and make sure everything
compiles fine (if not, return to your source directory, fix the
problem, delete <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, and start over).  Your
executable must be called <tt>router</tt>.

<li> test your executable and briefly describe the level of
functionality of your project in a file called <tt>y/status</tt> (a
file called <tt>status</tt> in directory <tt>y</tt>).  Be sure to
include one comment from the following set: "does not compile",
"compiles but does not run", "runs with bugs", or "runs well".  Also
be sure to describe the problems, if any, and the degree of testing
you have performed ("no tests", "tested against itself", "tested with
two other people").

<li> <tt>cd</tt> to directory <tt>y/..</tt> (the parent directory of
<tt>y</tt>)

<li> run the following commands:
<pre>
/usr/bin/tar cvf y.tar y
/usr/bin/uuencode y.tar y.tar > y.uu
/usr/ucb/mail -s p1 esb@hawaii.edu < y.uu
</pre>
(be sure to use /usr/ucb/mail, or the -s switch won't work).

<li> I will subtract points if you send me binary files

</ol>

<h2>Overall Design</h2>

Your program must:

<ul>

<li> read the command-line arguments, which specify the static routing
tables and the (simulated) interfaces and the simulators to which they are
connected

<li> start a thread for each interface.  The thread is in an infinite loop
reading from that interface (socket), and giving received packets to the
SLIP module.  Each packet has length 1, and carries one character,
simulating a serial line.

<li> do SLIP processing on each received and outgoing packet

<li> do IP processing on each received packet

<li> look up the destination in the tables to determine the next hop
in the route, and forward the packet along that (simulated) link

</ul>

<h2>Simulation</h2>

<p> You will simulate a collection of point-to-point links by a number
of UDP sockets (type <tt>SOCK_DGRAM</tt>, protocol <tt>"udp"</tt>).
Each socket will be used for a connection to a different simulator,
and will be bound to a different local port number.  Whenever a thread
is received on a socket, it is assumed to be coming from the remote
simulator that is logically connected to this interface.

<p> Each simulated serial cable (and corresponding simulated interface
or serial port) can be identified by this unique local UDP port
number.  This simulated interface is associated with an IP address and
real port number identifying the socket at the far end of the
simulated serial interface.

<p> You may assume that your router need not support any more than 100
different interfaces.

<p> To simulate receiving from a serial interface, you call
<tt>recvfrom</tt> on the corresponding socket (and ignore the address
information you receive).  To simulate sending to a serial interface,
you call <tt>sendto</tt> on the corresponding socket, specifying the
IP number and UDP port number of the remote simulator.

<p> Since UDP does not guarantee reliable transmission, packets could
get dropped by the receiving host if too many packets are sent at
once.  Also, since we are simulating a serial line running at 9600
baud, it makes sense to not send very fast.  Therefore, when you are
sending characters (one <tt>sendto</tt> operation for each character)
you should sleep about 800 microseconds (0.0008 seconds) between
successive calls to <tt>sendto</tt>.  The simplest way to do this is
probably to call <tt>nanosleep(3RT)</tt> (do not use <tt>usleep</tt>,
which might interfere with your threads).

<p> Sending one character at a time also requires you to establish a
lock on a port before a packet can be sent, to prevent different
threads trying to send their packet at the same time.  I would suggest
you look at the man page for <tt>pthread_mutex_init</tt> for details
of how to do this, as well as chapter 1 of the notes.  You may also
look at the man page for <tt>sem_init</tt>, if you prefer to use
semaphores.  Either mutexes or semaphores would be acceptable for this
projects.  Other strategies might also be fine, but please send me
mail before committing to them, so I can let you know if I disagree.

<p> You must call <tt>bind</tt> on the socket before using it, to
associate it with the appropriate port.  If the <tt>bind</tt> fails,
the program should die with an appropriate notice.

<p> You may or may not call <tt>connect</tt> on the socket before using
it.  If you do, you may use <tt>recv</tt> and <tt>send</tt> instead of
<tt>recvfrom</tt> and <tt>sendto</tt>.

<p> Build the simulator first, and test it in isolation.  Include
debugging code that will print all packets sent and received.

<h2>Threads</h2>

<p> Your program must be multithreaded, using the pthreads package.

<p> There main interaction between your threads is at the send queue.
Receive threads, after using the routing table to determine the
appropriate interface to send on, place the packet into the corresponding
queue.  If the queue was empty, the receive thread also creates a send
thread for that interface.  Queues have a maximum size of 3 packets.  If
there is no room in a queue, the packet must be discarded, and a message
printed to the screen.

<p> It is OK for a receive thread to have a single buffer of maximum
size 1006 bytes, to accept packets, give them to SLIP, do the routing,
place the thread in the receive queue, and then find or allocate a new
buffer.  Note that the total number of buffers in your router is
bounded by 4 * the number of interfaces (3 for the queues, and one for
the receive buffer).  If you allocate that many buffers at the
beginning, you should never run out of buffers, since if there is no
space, a packet is discarded and the buffer can be reused.

<h2>SLIP processing</h2>

Slip is described in detail in <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1055.txt">RFC 1055</a>.  You are
welcome to reuse and adapt any of the code they provide, or any of the
code in the notes (do not expect their code or my code to work in your
implementation without adapting it).

<h2>IP processing</h2>

<p> IP is described in <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc791.txt">RFC 791</a>, and will be
discussed in class as well (but please start building the simulator,
the threads, and the queues as soon as possible).  Further details
(not really applicable to this project, but for your interest) are
available in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt">RFC
1122</a>.

<p> The IP processing steps you are expected to do for this project includes:

<ol>

<li> decrement the TTL, and discard the packet (printing a message to the
screen) if the resulting TTL is zero.

<li> look up the destination address, and use it for routing, as
described below.

<li> place the packet into the appropriate output queue, and start
the corresponding output thread if necessary

</ol>

If you have extra time and you wish to do so, you may experiment with
fragmentation (a router never reassembles), header checksums, or IP
options.  No extra credit will be given, so make sure the rest of your
code is working first.

<h2>Destination Lookup</h2>

<p> This project uses the original class-oriented addressing described
in section 3.2 of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc791.txt">RFC
791</a>.  In other words, when comparing a destination address to a
route stored in our table, you only compare the number of bits
appropriate to the class of the destination IP address.  Note that if
the destination address is in class X (where X is A, B, or C) and the
table route is for an address in class Y, with Y != X, then you do not
need to compare X and Y -- Y cannot be a route to X.

<p> If no route is found, print a message to the screen and discard
the packet.

<p> If a route is found, do SLIP encoding, then place the packet in the
appropriate outgoing queue and, if necessary, start the send thread.


<h2>Command-line Arguments</h2>

<p> Command-line arguments are of two types, corresponding to routes
and (simulated) interface definitions.  The two types may be intermixed
arbitrarily on the command line.

<ol>

<li> simulated interfaces: of the form localport/remoteIP/remoteport.
The IPs and port numbers are real IPs and port numbers, used for the
simulator.  The local port number is also used as the identifier for
this interface, so in actual usage all the localports on a single
router simulator must be distinct.  Both port numbers are integers
between 1025 and 65535, the remoteIP is an IP address in dotted
decimal form (1.2.3.4) or a host name as resolved by
<tt>gethostbyname</tt>.  Hint: <tt>gethostbyname</tt> converts dotted
decimal notation as well as DNS names to internal formats.

<li> routes: of the form destination@interface, where the destination
is a (simulated) IP address in dotted decimal form (1.2.3.4), and
interface is an integer corresponding to the localport of the outgoing
interface for this route.

</ol>

<p>As an example, suppose I am running on 128.171.44.7 (uhunix2).  I
am simulating serial connections to two other simulators, one (system
A) running on port 1234 of uhunix2, and the other (system B) on port
23345 of uhunix3 (128.171.44.52).  My own localport numbers are 1235
(for the connection to system A) and 1236 (for the connection to
system B).  I also want a route each to the simulated addresses
1.2.3.4 and 128.171.0.1 through port 1235, and a route to
15.1.2.3 through port 1236.  Remembering that the order of arguments
is arbitrary, here is the command line:

<pre>
router 1235/128.171.44.7/1234 1.2.3.4@1235 128.171.0.1@1235 1236/128.171.44.52/23345 15.1.2.3@1236
</pre>
(you may need to scroll horizontally to see the entire command line).

<h2>Documentation</h2>

Since both I and your colleagues will be studying your code, please
provide suitable documentation explaining your thinking and providing
references or other indications of what you are doing.

<h2>Testing and Interoperation</h2>

<p>I plan to provide a simple program that will send correct IP
messages.  Once it is ready you will be able to use it for testing
your code.  I encourage you to start coding and testing as soon
as possible, even before this program is available.

<p> For full credit, you will have to interoperate with others' code.
You are welcome to use the <a href="mailto:ics651-l@hawaii.edu">course
mailing list</a> to find others to test with.

<p> I always find it useful to have a compile-time switch that allows
me to print all the packets I send and receive.  Something along the
lines of:

<pre>
  count = recvfrom (..., buffer, ...);
#ifdef DEBUG
  if (count > 0)
  {
    int i;

    printf ("received %d bytes: ", count);
    for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      printf("%02x.", (buffer [i]) & 0xff);
    }
    printf ("\n");
  }
#endif DEBUG
</pre>

<p>With this setup, turning on the <tt>-DDEBUG</tt> switch in the makefile
and recompiling everything will automatically enable debugging and allow
you to see where the packets are going.

<p>It might be helpful to put the above code into a function, and call
that function, but if DEBUG is not defined, the function does nothing.

<p><li> <strong>Strings</strong>.

<p>Data sent to and read from the network is not in C string format,
and specifically does not include the terminating NULL character.  If
you ever find yourself using the <tt>strlen</tt> function, it is highly
likely you are making a mistake.

<p>The number of bytes to write is determined by a byte count.  When
reading from the network, specify the buffer length and use the return
value from <tt>recv</tt> to determine how many bytes were actually read.

<p><li> <strong>Debugging</strong>.

<p>If you haven't done so already, you may want to learn to use the
<tt>gdb</tt> debugger, or any other debugger available on your system.
If you use <tt>gdb</tt>, you may want to check the <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html">
Manual</a>.
