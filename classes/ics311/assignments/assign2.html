Problem 1:  Iterative reversal of a Linked List (C-3.8)<p>
</b>

a.  <i>The reverse it algorithm in java:</i>
<pre>
    //Purpose:  to reverse a singly linked list.
    //Preconditions:  the method is passed the head node
    //   to a singly linked list.
    //Postconditions:  the linked list is reversed and the
    //   the returned Node is the new head node of the list,
    //   previously the tail Node.
    public Node reverseIt(Node n) {
        Node prev, next, temp;
        prev = null;
        next = n;
        while (next!=null) {
            temp = next.getNext();
            next.setNext(prev);
            prev = next;
            next = temp;
        }
        return prev;
    }
</pre>
b.  <i>Time complexity analysis of reverseIt:</i><p>

The assignment statement prev = null and next = n result in 2 primitive operations
before the while loop.  The while loop executes once for each node in the linked
list.  The while loop has a comparison next!= null, an assignment and method call
from temp = next.getNext(), an assignment and method call from
next.setNext(prev), and 2 assignments from prev = next and next = temp.  That makes
a total of 7 primitive operations for each iteration of the loop.  The failure of the while
loop results from one more comparison of next!=null and the return statement results in
one last primitive operation.<p>

That makes for 2 (before the loop) + 7n (during the loop) + 2 (failure comparison and return)
primitive operations for each Node n in the list.<p>

2 + 7n + 2 = 7n + 4 <= 7n + 4n = 11n for n>=1.  Therefore the algorithm is O(n) by the
definition of Big-Oh notation with c=11 and n<sub>0</sub>=1.<p>

c.  <i>Space complexity analysis of reverseIt:</i><p>

reverseIt is passed the head Node to a linked list and reverses the list.  In doing so,
no new Node objects are allocated and only 3 reference variables are used.  Let the space
needed for a reference variable to a Node object be some constant c<sub>0</sub>.  Then, our
algorithm uses 3c<sub>0</sub> space plus the overhead for a method call o.<p>

3c<sub>0</sub> + o <= (3c<sub>0</sub> + o)(1) for n>=1.  Therefore, the space complexity for this
algorithm is O(1) by the definition of Big-Oh with c=3c<sub>0</sub> + o and n<sub>0</sub>=1.<p>

Problem 2:  Implementing a Stack with Queues (C-3.10)<p>
</b>

a.  <i>Describe (with pseudocode) how to implement the stack ADT using two
queues.</i><p>

To implement a stack using two queues I would have a class that has
a queue, call it Q, as a private variable.  The interface algorithms
for the stack implemented with two queues would then look like this:

<pre>
Algorithm size():
    Input:  nothing
    Output:  the number of elements in the stack
    return Q.size()

Algorithm isEmpty():
    Input:  nothing
    Output:  true if the Stack is empty, false otherwise
    return Q.isEmpty()
    
Algorithm push(e):
    Input:  a new Object e to push onto the stack
    Output:  nothing
    Q.enqueue(e)

Algorithm pop():
    Input:  nothing
    Output:  the top Object from the stack
    if Q.isEmpty() then
        throw a StackEmptyException
    else
        create a queue tempQ
        while Q.size()>1 do
            tempQ.enqueue(q.dequeue())
        while !tempQ.isEmpty()
            Q.enqueue(tempQ.dequeue())
        return Q.dequeue();

Algorithm top():
    Input:  nothing
    Output:  the top Object from the stack
    if Q.isEmpty() then
        throw a StackEmptyException
    else
        create a queue tempQ
        while Q.size()>1 do
            tempQ.enqueue(Q.dequeue())
        while !tempQ.isEmpty() do
            Q.enqueue(tempQ.dequeue())
        Object e = q.front()
        Q.enqueue(Q.dequeue)            
        return e
</pre>
<i>Can you do it without any instance variables other than the two
queues?</i><p>
Yes, as you can see my implementation used only one private instance variable, the queue
Q.  In addition, a temporary queue tempQ was used in the methods pop() and top().<p>

b.  <i>Give the big-O running time of the push() and pop() methods for your
implementation.</i><p>

With my implementation of a Stack using Queues, the push() method will store the
pushed Object by adding it to the end of the queue.  Therefore, the push method
will have the same big-O running time as the enqueue(Object e) method of the
queue implementation.  The enqueue method is O(1) be it implemented with a circular
array or linked list with head and tail pointers, therefore, my push method is also
O(1).<p>

The pop() method is a little more complex for my implementation of a stack using
queues and is where the real work is done in simulating a stack.  The method works
by dequeueing all but the last item from queue Q into temporary queue tempQ.  Then,
all the items in tempQ are enqueued back into Q.  This leaves the "last in" item at
the front of Q and a simple return Q.dequeue() returns it as desired.  The creation
of the temporary queue executes in a constant amount of time independant of n, the
number of items in the stack, and is therefore O(1).  The first loop executes n-1
times and the operation in the loop is O(1) so the first loop is O(n).  The second
loop also executes n-1 times and the operation in the loop is O(1) therefore it
is O(n).  Lastly the return line executes which calls Q.dequeue() which is an O(1)
operation.  The total running time of pop() is characterized by the sum of the four
terms, O(1) (for the creation of the temporary queue), O(n) (for the first loop), O(n)
(for the last loop), and O(1) (for the return statement.  Overall this makes the
algorithm O(n).<p>

Problem 3:  Searching a sequence recursively (R-4.6)<p>
</b>
a.  <i>Using the Sequence ADT, write a Java method public boolean member(int
k, Sequence s) for determining whether a sequence S of n integer objects
contains a given integer k.  Your method should not contain any loops.</i>
<pre>
    //Purpose:  determine whether a Sequence contains an Integer object with
    //    intValue() k
    //Preconditions:  this method is passed an int k and a Sequence S
    //Postconditions:  if an Integer object with intValue() k is found, true
    //    is returned, otherwise, false is returned
    public boolean member(int k, Sequence S) {
        if (S.isEmpty())
            return false;
        else if (((Integer)S.first()).intValue()==k)
            return true;
        else {
            Integer n = (Integer)S.first();
            S.removeElemAtRank(1);
            boolean found = member(k,S);
            S.insertFirst(n);
            return found;
        }
    }
</pre>
b.  <i>What is the time complexity of your algorithm?  Give big-O in terms of n.</i><p>

The worst case time complexity for this algorithm occurs when the int k is not found in
the sequence.  In this case the algorithm will recursively check each element in the
sequence and then be called one more time for the base case of the sequence being empty.
Therefore, given n elements in the sequence the method will be called n+1 times.<p>

In each of the first n calls before the base case is reached, it can be shown that the
execution path will flow to the else clause and only primitive operations or method
calls that are O(1) are executed.  Therefore each of the n calls performs a constant
number of primitive operations j>1, resulting in jn total primitive operations.<p>

The final recursive call will occur when the base case is reached in which the method is
called with an empty sequence.  In this call the first branch of the if statement will
execute.  Once again only an O(1) operation (.isEmpty()) and 1 primitive operation (return false)
will be performed.  Therefore the base case recursive call of the algorithm contributes
a constant number of primitive operations k>1.<p>

jn + k <= jn + kn = (j + k)n for n>=1, therefore, this algorithm is O(n) by the definition
of Big-Oh notation with c = j + k and n<sub>0</sub>=1.<p>

c.  <i>How much space does your method use in addition to the space used for S?  Give
big-O in terms of n.</i><p>

My method works by testing to see if the first element in the sequence is a match, and if not,
strips the first element into a temporary variable and then makes a recursive call with the
reduced sequence.  After returning from the recursive call, the element is put back in its
proper place.  In the worst case a match will not be found and the entire sequence will
need to be examined resulting in n + 1 total calls, that is, n calls for the n elements in the
sequence and 1 last call as the base case is reached.  Therefore my method will end up
allocating a temporary variable for every element in the sequence and will have the overhead
of the activation frames in Java for the n + 1 method calls.  The temporary variable space and
activation frame overhead are both O(n) space complexity and therefore the overall space complexity
is O(n).<p>
It is interesting to note that the temporary variable space used by my method is offset by the
decrease in the size of the sequence, however, even when you look at the algorithm from that
perspective the overhead for the activation frames of the recursive calls still causes the space
complexity of the algorithm to be O(n).<p>

<b>
Problem 4:  An iterative tree traversal (C-5.17)<p>
</b>
a.  <i>Describe in pseudo-code a non-recursive method for performing an in-order
traversal of a binary tree in linear time.</i><p>

<pre>
Algorithm inorder(rootNode):
    Input:  a reference to the root node of the tree
    Output:  an in-order traversal of the tree is performed
    create a Stack S
    curr = rootNode
    done = false
    while !done do
       if curr!=null
           S.push(curr)
           curr = curr.getLeft()
       else
           if !S.isEmpty()
               curr = S.pop()
               //visit S
               curr = curr.getRight()
           else
               done = true
</pre>

b.  <i>Show that your algorithm runs in linear time.</i><p>
The major work for this algorithm is done in the while loop.  The algorithm works by
maintaining a stack of nodes.  A node is pushed onto the stack and then its left subtree
is followed in the next iteration of the loop.  When that node is returned to in the
stack it is then visited, removed from the stack, and then the its right subtree
is followed in the next iteration of the loop.  Therefore, for every node in the binary
tree we have 2 iterations of the while loop.  One for when it is pushed on and curr is
set to its left reference, and one for when it is popped off and curr is set to its right
reference.  In addition there will be one iteration of the while loop when the stack is
completely empty and the traversal is over.  Therefore, given the 2n + 1 iterations of the
loop plus the constant time operation of creating the stack S and two primitive operations
before the loop make for an algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n), which shows that
it runs in linear time.<p>

c.  <i>Also analyze the space complexity.</i><p>

Because nodes are removed before visiting the right subtree, the worst case space
complexity will result when all n nodes of the binary tree are left nodes descending
in a linear manner from the head node.  In this case, the stack will grow to size n
to accomodate every node in the binary tree before any pop() methods will be called.
Therefore the worst case space complexity for this algorithm is O(n).<p>

Problem 5:  Deletion from a heap in the sequence representation<p>

a.  <i>Write out the sequence representation of the heap in Figure 6.8g (also shown
in 6.9).</i><p>
<blockquote>
4, 5, 6, 15, 9, 7, 20, 16, 25, 14, 12, 11, 8, 23, 27

b.  <i>Show, in the sequence representation, all the steps of the algorithm for doing
removeMinElement() on this heap.</i><p>

The first step in performing removeMinElement() will remove and return
the minimum element while copying the last element into the first position:<p>

Now the process of down-heap bubbling will continue until 27 has fallen
to its proper location:<p>
