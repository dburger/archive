The goals of this project are:
<ol>
<li> to implement a web server
<li> to learn HTTP
<li> to practice using the sockets interface
</ol>

<p>This is an individual project.  You may discuss concepts and ideas
with other students, but you should be the sole author of all your
code.  All your code must be written in C.

<p> Submission is electronic (see <a href="#results">below</a>).
Submission must be on time -- late submissions will not be graded and
will receive no credit.  So please submit what you have
on the due date, by 11:59pm HST on September 28th.

<p>The assignment is to write a simple HTTP/1.0 web server.  The server
is unusual in that it does not serve the file specified in the URL.
Instead, it accesses the specified file, searches through it for
references, randomly selects one of the references, and
and forwards the contents of that reference to the client.

<p> Forwarding the contents is similar to what a web proxy might do.

<p> Selecting one of the links at random is similar to what the quiz
server does.

<h2>HTTP version 1.0</h2>

HTTP version 1.0 is described in <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt?number=1945">RFC
1945</a>.  Do NOT print out the entire RFC on the departmental printer
-- there are large sections you do not need.  Please read it online
and only print out the sections you really need (or print it on a
printer you own with paper you bought).

<p>Note: RFC 1945 is a long document.  Part of this assignment is to
read and understand the document, and identify which parts are
relevant to this project and useful to you.

<h2>Project Deliverables</h2>

I will expect the following from each student:

<ol>

<li> The source code (source and makefile only -- no objects,
binaries, or random files) for your implementation.  The source code
must compile and run on uhunix2.  Compilation must be achieved by
running ``make'' with no arguments (see <tt>make(1S)</tt>).  You
should also include a file <tt>status</tt> that describes whether
your program works and if not, what problems you are having.

<li> Create a web page with links to each of your source files,
make file, and status file, and make it readable to the entire
world.  You do not need to publish the web page.

<li> Send the URL for that web page to the <a
href="mailto:esb@hawaii.edu">instructor</a>.  Your web page must
remain available for at least one week, giving the instructor, TAs,
and your colleagues plenty of time to download it and review it.  If
we are unable to download your page automatically on the deadline, you
will get no credit for the course.  I suggest posting the web page and
placing the files in your <tt>public_html</tt> directory on
<tt>uhunix</tt>, and making sure you can access them through
<tt>http://www2.hawaii.edu/~yourlogin</tt>.

<li> Please follow the naming instructions: name your makefile
<tt>makefile</tt> (all lower case), and your status file
<tt>status</tt> (no extension).

<li> Please turn in your project by the deadline.  After the deadline
you will be asked to review others' projects, and therefore you can
get no credit for any work turned in after the deadline.

</ol>

<h2>Program</h2>

<p>I want you to write a forwarding web server (called
<tt>webselect</tt>).  The web server loads the specified html file
(only files ending in <tt>.html</tt> or <tt>.htm</tt> should be loaded
in this first step) and parses it.

<p> The path <tt>/home/1/esb/public_html/</tt> (or, for your own
testing, <tt>/home/n/yourlogin</tt> -- but remember to change it back
before submitting) should be placed before whatever path is specified
in the URL itself, so that all html files specified to your server are
relative to <tt>/home/1/esb/public_html/</tt>.

<p> The purpose of parsing is to extract all the HTML references in
the page.  References are identified by the string "<tt>href=</tt>",
which may have arbitrary capitalization.  <tt>webselect</tt> must then
return to the client the contents of one, randomly selected reference.

<p>The references themselves may point to pages that are not HTML pages, for
example images or plain text.  For this project, you must be able
to process references to files with the following extension and MIME type:

<ul>
<li> extension <tt>.html</tt> or <tt>.htm</tt>, type <tt>text/html</tt>
<li> extension <tt>.txt</tt> or <tt>.text</tt>, type <tt>text/plain</tt>
<li> extension <tt>.jpeg</tt> or <tt>.jpg</tt>, type <tt>image/jpeg</tt>
<li> extension <tt>.gif</tt>, type <tt>image/gif</tt>
</ul>

<p> The references may be to files that are on the local machine or on
other servers.  If the files are on other servers, <tt>webselect</tt>
must act as a proxy, retrieving the file from the other server and
sending the contents to the client.  The header sent by the other
server may be forwarded, unchanged, directly to the client.

<p> If the references are to files that are on the local machine,
<tt>webselect</tt> must act as a server, returning a header to the
client, reading the file, and sending it back.  The file reference
might be absolute, if it begins with a <tt>"/"</tt> character, or
relative to the directory in which the original html file was found.

<p> In summary, <tt>webselect</tt> should return the contents of one
of the references, randomly chosen.

<p><b>Calling Sequence</b>: <tt>webselect</tt> must take one or two
arguments.  The first argument is the port number and is required, and
<tt>webselect</tt> should terminate if it is not present.  The second
argument is optional.  If it is present, it is an integer <tt>n</tt>
giving the number of the selection to return.  When this argument is
present, <tt>webselect</tt> <b>must</b>, the first time it is called,
return the <tt>n</tt>th reference (<tt>n</tt> can take any value from
1, 2, 3, ...).  If <tt>n</tt> is out of range (i.e. there is no
<tt>n</tt>th reference), <tt>webselect</tt> <b>must</b> terminate the
first time a client connects to it with a valid file.  After the first
connection, <tt>webselect</tt> <b>must</b> return to using the random
selection.

<p> Synopsis of the calling sequence:
<pre>
usage: webselect port [selection]

webselect will terminate if the arguments are not integers,
if the port is already in use, or if the selection (if specified)
fails to identify a valid reference in the URL specified in the first
access to the server.  The first reference is number 1.
</pre>

<a name="Hints"> </a><h2>Hints</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Solaris Warning</strong>

On Solaris, you should be aware that the <tt>accept</tt> system call
will return -1 if it is interrupted by a signal.  You must then
compare the global variable <tt>errno</tt> (see <tt>man errno</tt>) to
<tt>EINTR</tt> to see if it failed because of the interrupt, and if
so, repeat the call.  Other Unixes don't have this property, but if
you write code that works on Solaris, it should work well on other
Unixes as well.

<li><strong>Random selection</strong>

Please use <tt>random(3C)</tt> to make your random selection.  Do not
use <tt>rand(3C)</tt>.  I suggest you do NOT call
<tt>srandom(3C)</tt>, <tt>initstate(3C)</tt>, or <tt>setseed(3C)</tt>,
so your program will be repeatable and easier for you to test.

<li><strong>Telnet Program</strong>

The telnet program on Unix accepts an optional second argument: a port
number.  If you telnet to uhunix2 (or whatever machine you are running
your server on) and specify the port number your server is listening
on, you will be able to enter text and see the responses.  Telnet
on Unix generally terminates lines with the single character <tt>\n</tt>,
so in order to test in this manner, your program will need to be
flexible about how lines are terminated.

<p>If you want to use telnet to connect to a server on the same machine,
you can simply <tt>telnet localhost portnumber</tt>

<p>Port numbers below 1025 are generally reserved for systems servers
(the <tt>root</tt> user on Unix), so use higher numbers

<li><strong>Testing</strong>

<p>After testing using telnet, you should test using a regular web
browser (or two, or 10).  Most machines have a specific web browser,
for example Netscape or IE, and <tt>uhunix2</tt> also has the
<tt>lynx</tt> text-only browser.  Be sure your server works with both
Netscape or IE, and with lynx.  You can specify port numbers in URLs
by putting a colon after the machine name followed by the port:
<pre> http://www.ics.hawaii.edu:99/path </pre> does an HTTP request on port
99 of www.ics.hawaii.edu, requesting <tt>/path</tt>.

<p>You should also test using the TA's test program, which should be
available at least a week before the deadline.  Plan for this
debugging phase to take at least a week.

<p>When testing a network program, there is always the question of
knowing what exactly my program is sending, and what exactly it is
receiving from the peer.  I strongly suggest that you add to your
program a compile-time option (disable it before turning in the
program) that allows you to see, and maybe save in a file, the entire
exchange between your server and the client.


<p><li> <strong>Strings</strong>.

<p> Data read from the network is not in C string format (even though
HTTP uses ASCII encoding), and specifically does not include the
terminating NULL character.

<p> When sending a C string, you can use <tt>strlen</tt> to decide how
many bytes to write (because you are sending ASCII -- if you were
sending binary, you would be unable to use <tt>strlen</tt>).  When
reading from the network, specify the buffer length and use the return
value from <tt>read</tt> to determine how many bytes were read.

<p> Remember that your program may or may not get all the data in a
single read.  The test program will specifically test to make sure
your program handles the case where not all the data is received at
once.  You may have to do multiple reads to get the entire request
header, and you may have to do multiple reads to get the entire
contents when you are acting as a proxy.  Be sure you have received
the entire request header before processing the request (however, when
acting as a proxy you may start to forward data as soon as you receive
it -- just make sure you don't stop until you are done).

<p><li> <strong>Line Termination</strong>.

<p>HTTP uses CRLF (<tt>\r\n</tt>) as a line terminator, but not all
browsers and servers implement that, and your program should work
correctly whether lines are terminated with CR, LF, or CRLF.  Remember
that you should be generous in what you accept, and strict in what you
send.

<p>Part of this project is to parse data received from the network.
Parsing in C is often done with "lex" and "yacc".  Both of these are
available on uhunix2.  I suggest that you study them to decide whether
they might be the best way of implementing your parser.  There is no
requirement that you use lex or yacc -- you may do your own parsing if
you prefer.

<p><li> <strong>Server</strong>.

<p>The server I gave in <a
href="http://www2.ics.Hawaii.Edu/~esb/1997fall.ics651/uxcliser.html">homework
1 in a past course</a> may give you ideas for <tt>webselect</tt> (I
also encourage you to study that homework for more ideas about
client-server programming).  Feel free to use both that server and the
code in the textbook as a basis for this project.  Do not use any
other code, unless you have written it yourself.

<p><li> <strong>Debugging</strong>.

<p>If you haven't done so already, you may want to learn to use the
<tt>gdb</tt> debugger, or any other debugger available on your system.
If you use <tt>gdb</tt>, you may want to check the <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html">
GDB Manual</a>.

<p><li> <strong>String Searching</strong>.

<p>You are welcome to use this <a href="strcasestr.html">
case-independent string matching function</a>.
